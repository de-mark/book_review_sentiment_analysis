       "[\"In this exhilarating novel, two friends--often in love, but never lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.\\n\\nOn a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, . Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.\\n\\nSpanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.\",\n",
       " \"GABRIELLE ZEVIN is a New York Times best-selling novelist whose books have been translated into forty languages.\\n\\nHer tenth novel, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow was published by Knopf in July of 2022 and was an instant New York Times Best Seller, a Sunday Times Best Seller, a USA Today Best Seller, a #1 National Indie Best Seller, and a selection of the Tonight Show’s Fallon Book Club. Maureen Corrigan of NPR’s Fresh Air called it, “a big beautifully written novel…that succeeds in being both serious art and immersive entertainment.” Following a twenty-five-bidder auction, the feature film rights to Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow were acquired by Temple Hill and Paramount Studios. She is currently writing the screenplay.\\n\\nThe Storied Life of A.J. Fikry spent many months on the New York Times Best Seller List, reached #1 on the National Indie Best Seller List, was a USA Today Best Seller, and has been a best seller all around the world. A.J. Fikry was honored with the Southern California Independent Booksellers Award for Fiction, the Japan Booksellers’ Prize, and was long listed for the International Dublin Literary Award, among other honors. To date, the book has sold over five-million copies worldwide. It is now a feature film with a screenplay by Zevin. Young Jane Young won the Southern Book Prize and was one of the Washington Post’s Fifty Notable Works of Fiction.\\n\\nShe is the screenwriter of Conversations with Other Women (Helena Bonham Carter) for which she received an Independent Spirit Award Nomination for Best First Screenplay. She has occasionally written criticism for the New York Times Book Review and NPR’s All Things Considered, and she began her writing career, at age fourteen, as a music critic for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. Zevin is a graduate of Harvard University. She lives in Los Angeles.\\n\\nNOTE: Apologies, but Gabrielle doesn't reply to messages on Goodreads.\",\n",
       " 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow I will still be thinking about this brilliant book.\\n\\nFair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don’t have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.\\n\\nIt must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.\\n\\nThey are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.\\n\\nI do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.\\n\\nAlso, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.\\n\\nI feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?\\n\\nMy sincere thanks to the author and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the gifted review copy via NetGalley. Now available.\\n\\nBlog:',\n",
       " \"Complicated and Memorable\\n\\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.\\n\\nSam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.\\n\\nThe narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs. The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view).\\n\\nSam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact.\\n\\nThe novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.\\n\\n\\n\\nI got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming. There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.\\n\\n\\n\\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\",\n",
       " 'I feel... really disappointed by this. I\\'ve loved Zevin\\'s books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn\\'t make this book any less tedious for me.\\n\\nThe story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children\\'s ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.\\n\\nI will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.\\n\\nThat being said, I do not consider \"gamer\" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.\\n\\nKirkus assured me that even those who \"have never played a video game in their lives\" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn\\'t true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.\\n\\nSome people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn\\'t all that long. It feels much longer.',\n",
       " \"three things:\\n1) i did not like any of these three main characters to start, and i grew to intensely dislike them\\n2) i could not put this book down\\n3) it has been 4 months since i read this book, i cannot in good faith put this review off any longer, and i still do not know if i liked this or not.\\n\\nthat's all i got.\\n\\nbottom line: you take the wins with the losses in this life.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\nsuddenly decided i NEED to read this\",\n",
       " 'Starts off super strong and readable. It felt like YA but for adults. Falls apart as it goes on. Lots of cliche in the 2nd half which starts to feel irritating by the end. It could’ve been 100 pages shorter easily.',\n",
       " \"***5 Stars***\\n\\nThis was one of those books where, when someone asks you what the book you are reading is about, you are kind of at a loss for words. Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).\\n\\nDespite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.\\n\\nWell, while I can't say that I'm lazy or that my mind mush despite never being a gamer, I say that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, I sucked at anyway.\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nLike I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes and no.\\n\\nThis was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.\\n\\nIn today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent upon having to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.\\n\\nShowing not telling.\\nAllowing me to the message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.\\nSo refreshing.\\n\\nAlso, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.\\n\\nOriginally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.\\n\\nP.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.\\nP.P.S. You do need to love Marx.\",\n",
       " \"this was a hard pass for me. I know I'm in the minority, but I do not need to be emotionally and traumatically destroyed while reading. The prose was pretentious and unnecessary. Both characters are rather insufferable, immature, and showed no growth. For a book supposedly celebrating friendship, this was the definition of a TOXIC, unhealthy platonic relationship between male & female. I'm honestly not sure what the moral of the story was? Other than let's make sure to include every single controversial issue possible and make our stance known. I also really despise murky endings.\\n\\nevery CW imaginable: gun violence, death, suicide, grief, car accident, toxic relationship, shooting, injury jury, homophobia, chronic illness, racism, sexism, toxic friendship (and more…)\",\n",
       " 'this book made my heart ache.\\n\\nthe lives of sam and sadie are raw and complicated and messy. the narrative is such an accurate depiction of human growth and the adjustments friendships have to go through because of those changes. and, just like real life, not everything goes according to their plans. there were life choices of theirs that i didnt agree with and moments when i was 110% rooting for their successes. some sections where i was bored with the uneventfulness of their careers and other chapters that had me riveted by the worlds they created.\\n\\nwhile i do wish there was more of a traditional plot and quicker pacing at times, theres no denying that i came to care about sam and sadie.',\n",
       " \"Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't particularly enthralled.\\n\\nA lack of concentration plagues Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, a novel I found to be lacking. The narrative jumps from the present to various points in the past without providing the reader with an opportunity to get emotionally invested in any of the protagonists, except maybe Marx.\\n\\nIn general, the overall writing was pleasant. Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious.\\n\\nThe story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay woke to be obnoxious. While I respect her intention to raise awareness about pressing social concerns, I found that her preachiness frequently derailed the narrative and detracted from the plot. I find it fascinating when authors of fiction skillfully weave explorations of societal concerns into the fabric of their narratives. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Zenin did not carry out this action.\\n\\nFinally, while the first half of the book is interesting and well written, the second half falls apart under the weight of its own ambitions.\\n\\nShould you still read it? Probably based on all the other reviews.\\n\\nRating: 3\",\n",

       " 'edit 02/20/2023: bumped this up to a 5 because my mental stability is gone\\n\\n\"The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.\"\\n\\n\\noccasionally, i would read a book that leaves me speechless, unable to grasp my emotions. this is one of those times.\\n\\ni won\\'t give a summary of because i am incapable of doing it even if i want to. in my opinion, the synopsis doesn\\'t do it justice, either. the best way to understand this book is to experience it yourself.\\n\\nthis is a tragedy intertwined with a love story, but not any love story. i went into this expecting to read something like , and i closed this book knowing that no story resembles this one.\\n\\nis an incredible tour de force. to write something as meta as the process of making video games with a lyrism this profound is no easy task. Zevin\\'s descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author\\'s courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting.\\n\\nultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don\\'t think i have cared for characters this deeply since . sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that\\'s how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones.\\n\\nand god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this?\\n\\nin the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) but will stay in my mind and my heart for a long time.\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nthis book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell.\\n\\nrtc once i recover',\n",
       " 'This book is so utterly pretentiousness and trying so hard to be woke that I should have given up on it instead of seeing it to the end. I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.\\n\\nThe story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.\\n\\nOne of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.',\n",
       " \"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\\nJennifer Kim (Narrator), Julian Cihi (Narrator)\\n\\nYoung Sam and Sadie meet in the hospital, brought together by a love of gaming. Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over.\\n\\nEight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways.\\n\\nThis is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on.\\n\\nThis story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together.\\n\\nThere is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.\\n\\nPub July 5, 2022\",\n",
       " 'My gosh, this book was never ending. It felt like the same story over and over: friends fight, make up and make a video game together, fight again, everyone switches partners, make another game…I’m sorry, but none of the characters were convincing—would you really call your unborn child a parasite? Would you really not talk to your business partner for months? Not talk to your best friend for years because of one little tiff? Everyone is reviewing this book as some great example of friendship, but that’s not how I’d treat my friends. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.',\n",
       " 'This is my first taste of author Gabrielle Zavin, and I have to say I was impressed, this is beautifully written and smart storytelling that goes back and forth in time, embedded in the world of gaming. I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively.\\n\\nMemories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life.\\n\\nWe are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.',\n",

       " 'A tale of friendship, a lesson in love and a perpetual game of life with its infinite number of second chances, lost opportunities and endless possibilities. And at the centre - love and friendship of course.\\n\\n“What is a game?\" Marx said. \"It\\'s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It\\'s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more.\\n\\nHowever, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx.\\n\\nWhile the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary.\\n\\nMy favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‘real’.\\n\\nThere are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare’s Macbeth (and others) “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn’t work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion.\\n\\nI also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me.\\n\\nA modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness.\\n\\nThe focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam’s relationship and the quote that says it all…\\n\\n\\n\\nI loved that “Love is both constant and variable”. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.',\n",

Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read.\\n\\nHowever, when I tried to get into another book – the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that this book covers several decades so it’s hard to describe all that happens with these characters!!\\n\\nSam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!!\\n\\nSadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc.\\n\\nThere is a point where Sadie and Sam don’t see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there.

I love this quote from Marx\\n\\nI already miss these characters so much! I would encourage you to give this novel a try, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life!!!\\n\\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.',\n",
       " 'So I found this book very entertaining and easy to read and also disappointing at times too. Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling in Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow that helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky.\\n\\nI also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy.\\n\\nI think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out to one of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!)\\n\\nAs a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’s and earlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too in , though I don’t recommend her other books lol.\\n\\nI also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literally\\nLike, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (like depicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s.\\n\\nAnyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure.',\n",

It was subtle—but not-not unnoticed.\\nSo…..parents: I wouldn’t worry if you can’t get your kid to stop playing games too much. It’s amazing how much they are learning about life….in relationship to others.\\n\\nOne more thing I must say …..then I’ll leave a few excerpts…\\nI thought the very beginning was MASTERFULLY written. I can’t remember ever reading a book that pointed to the ‘past, present, and the future’ at the same time more magnificently. SO WELL DONE!!!\\n\\nOk….enough of my excitement….\\nHere are some excerpts:\\n\\n“Before Mazer invented himself as Mazer, he was Samson Mazer, and before he was Samson Mazer, he was Samson Mazur—a change of two letters that transformed him from a nice ostensibly jewish boy to a Professional Builder of Worlds— and for most of his youth he was Sam—S.A.M. on the hall of fame of his grandfather’s ‘Donkey Kong’ machine, but mainly Sam”.\\nNOTE: the above excerpt— written at the start- is worth reading a few times. (IMO)….then let it go…..it will show up in different ways through the rest of the novel.\\n\\n“Sadie! SADIE! He felt foolish. SADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!”\\n“Finally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling—one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on top—and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him”.\\n“It’s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur, Sadie said. I died of exhaustion, following a snakebite”.\\n“And of not wanting to shoot the bison, Sam said”.\\n“It’s wasteful. All that meat just rots”.\\n“Sadie through her arms around him. Sam Masur! I kept hoping I’d run into you”.\\n\\n“What brings you to Harvard Square? Sam asked”.\\n“Why the Magic Eye, of course, she said playfully. She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60-by-40-inch poster that transformed commuters into zombie horde”.\\n“SEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. THIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE”.\\n\\nSadie….with those\\nheterochromic eyes…..\\n“In which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee, Sam said. Or whatever you drink, if coffee’s too much of a cliché for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There’s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it’s hours for the partaking”.\\n“If this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right one’s this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave”.\\n\\n“You would think women would want to stick together when there weren’t many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn’t wish to catch. As long as you didn’t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: ‘I’m not like those other ones’. Sadie was, by nature, a loner, but even she found going to MIT in a female body to be an isolating experience. The year Sadie was admitted to MIT, women were slightly over a third of her class, but somehow, it felt like even less than that. Sadie sometimes felt as if she could go weeks without seeing a woman. It might have been that the men, most of them at least, assumed you were stupid if you were a woman”.\\n\\n“What is a game? … It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s a possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever”.\\n\\n\\nWonderful….as wonderful as can be!!!',\n",

Gaming was a mystery to me, until now.\\n\\nZevin loosely provides the history of the gaming industry through her three characters. Sam and Sadie meet by coincidence at a Los Angeles hospital. Sam is recovering from a serious auto accident. Sadie is there visiting her sister who has cancer. The two, who are both 11, meet playing Super Mario Brothers in the children’s ward rec room. As a result of a misunderstanding, the two part on poor terms. Sam sees Sadie in a Cambridge Massachusetts train station when they are of university age. Sam goes to MIT and Sadie goes to Harvard. They decide to collaborate on a game. Marx is Sam’s roommate, a theater major. Marx becomes involved in the enterprise because both Sam and Sadie are techs and need a business manager.\\n\\nThis is a story of brilliant artists who create something big and exceptional. It a story of a friendship and love. It’s a journey of three innovative artists and their struggles. Zevin adds cultural depth in making Sam and Marx mixed-race Asian Americans. Their racial ambiguity was especially difficult in the 1990’s and early 2000’s.\\n\\nThe pains of the creative process is felt in the story. Who contributed the best part? Who’s getting all the credit? Fame and money become the trio’s downfall. This isn’t a story of game development. This is a story of friends and their personal life with snippets of the work and emotions involved in creating a computer game.\\n\\nI enjoyed every word of this novel. It’s beautifully written. I was captivated in their gaming world and their personal lives. Sadie and Sam are geniuses who are personally self-destructive. Marx is the guy who can sooth ruffled feathers. It’s a friendship story, a love story, and a bit of the gaming world.\\n\\nThank you Gabrielle Zevin! I think I sort of understand my son’s obsession with his alternative universe. I do like the idea that if you die, you can restart your game.',\n",
       " \"I hate to come in and be a Debbie Downer for this book, but sometimes this happens. There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me.\\n\\nThe thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together.\\n\\nAbout halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag,\\n\\n\\nI do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games.\\n\\nThere were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.).\\n\\nI just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack.\\n\\nI did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.\",\n",

Am sure it is a well written book but it was truly boring me and I found myself skimming pages, and I knew I just had to dnf it, sadly.\\n\\nSam and Sadie are one dimensional characters (that's based on how much I've read). Marx was a cool guy but even he couldn't keep me interested.\\n\\nWith the amount of books I have on my tbr I don't believe I'll ever check it out again.

       " '4.5⭐️\\n\\nSeventy-year-old Tova Sullivan works the nightshift as a cleaner at Sowell Bay Aquarium. She lives alone, recently widowed and her eighteen-year-old son having disappeared almost thirty years ago. Though financially stable, Tova believes in keeping herself occupied and enjoys her work and the company of the aquatic life in the aquarium, among whom is Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus, who was taken in as a rescue and at the beginning of the novel is on Day 1299 of his four-year (1460 day) life span. His observations and ruminations on human beings (which are shared in the first person in snippets throughout the narrative) are laced with humor (with a touch of snark) and wisdom. He is after all a ‘remarkably bright creature’ who also happens to venture out of his tank at nighttime, never exceeding the eighteen minutes beyond which would result in “consequences” as he cannot survive longer than that outside his tank. On one of his nocturnal adventures, Tova ends up saving him from harm and they form a special bond. Though Tova has a supportive group of friends, she is concerned about not having anyone to look after her in her advanced age and begins to consider the option of selling her home and moving into an upscale retirement facility. As the story progresses we also meet thirty-year-old Cameron Cassmore who travels to Sowell Bay, Washington from Modesto, California in search of information about his family connections. Abandoned by his mother as a child and raised by his aunt, he has recently become aware of possible family connections that lead him to Sowell Bay. He hasn’t done much with his life till now, is unable to hold a steady job and has been recently dumped by his girlfriend who was fed up with his lack of initiative and whimsical nature. Cameron, Tova and Marcellus connect when he starts working at the aquarium and what follows is a deeply moving story of friendship, community, family, grief and moving on.\\n\\nThe author’s portrayal of a close-knit small-town community and sensitive depiction of issues such as loss, grief, loneliness and aging will touch your heart. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the story is very well told and nowhere in the narrative do you lose interest or experience boredom. Marcellus is adorable and is a reminder of how precious our animal friends are to us especially in moments of loneliness and sorrow. The story also makes you ponder over the plight of animals in captivity. Though none of the animals in this story were harmed or ill-treated, you cannot help but feel sympathy for Marcellus when he feels imprisoned within the glass walls of the aquarium and misses his natural habitat.\\n\\nSet in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, with a lively cast of characters (human and cephalopod), engaging and well-paced narrative and a perfect combination of emotion, humor, wit and wisdom (suspend disbelief and you will enjoy the story!), Shelby Van Pelt’s Remarkably Bright Creatures is a beautiful story that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you with a lump in your throat and a smile on your face.\\n\\nI thank the author and publisher for providing a DRC of this wonderful book via Edelweiss+.

Doing this job helps her with the grief of losing her husband. There is another grief that has been with her for many decades, since her eighteen year old son died, his body never found.\\n\\nTova loves cleaning the floors, windows, tanks, and the seal statue that was a favorite of her son when he was little. For Tova, this job is a life saver, a place for her to be, a place she is needed, welcomed, and cherished by the aquarium manager. And then something very special happens! Tova meets curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. She already knew Marcellus, just as she knew all the other aquarium creatures but she never KNEW him before she and Marcellus meet face to face in an amazing way. Thus begins a lifelong friendship between Tova and Marcellus. Lifelong considering the short length of life that Marcellus has left since he is at the end of his four year lifespan.\\n\\nThere is another important person in this story and it's thirty year old Cameron Cassmore, a man who has never really grown up or found his place in life. He's never met his father and his mother abandoned him when he was nine. Cameron has a lot of growing up to do, having never held a job that he wasn't fired from, having never learned to pick up his own socks, and having never been someone anyone could rely on. But he's in Sowell Bay now, on the prowl to find out the secrets to his past, hoping what he finds will pay off, if possible.\\n\\nI loved this story, the people, Marcellus, and gray Cat. The audiobook narration could not be better. Marin Ireland does her usual wonderful job while Michael Urie IS Marcellus. He's now a new favorite narrator of mine. I avoid animal stories because I usually can't handle things happening to animals but this is a story about giving life to both animals and humans and that giving makes future loss bearable. Even if we can't keep something forever, we don't want to miss the chance of the time we can spend with those we can love and cherish.\\n\\nPub May 3, 2022 by HarperAudio\",\n",

Like the hunt for the real estate guy just took so long. Any middle aged real estate agent would have a Facebook. Cam could have looked him up and dmed him, no need to drive a fuel inefficient vehicle all over Washington.\\n\\nI can see why this is such a popular book there are a lot of heart warming aspects like the Octopus detective and the rich character descriptions are great, but I just couldn't stomach Cameron who thought it was OK to walk around with chocolate on his face smelling like other people's urine.\",\n",
       " 'Given the current state of the world, one needs a charming story that tugs at the heart yet is uplifting. “Remarkably Bright Creatures” is the perfect novel that will take your mind away from current politics and an unsettled world. Plus, an octopus is one of the main characters! Who doesn’t love a good cephalopod story? For those who are familiar with octopuses and their clever antics, you enjoy this story.\\n\\nMarcellus McSquiddles, a giant Pacific octopus who is held in Sowell Bay Aquarium (and a bit of a curmudgeon) begins the story narrating his life in captivity. He has a special relationship with the nightly cleaner, Tova Sullivan. Tova is a widower whose eighteen-year-old son went missing over thirty years ago, and she still feels the loss daily. Tova is an excellent cleaner who takes her job seriously. She’s seventy years old and is on the verge of retiring. Yet she loves all her exhibits of sea life.\\n\\nTova is part of a group of women who call themselves “the Knit-Wits” who also provide some smiles in this wonderful read, and she works at the aquarium at night. Marcellus has been getting bold in his endeavors to find tasty fresh seafood. Yes, he has fun escaping a nibbling on other exhibits and keeping Tova on her toes.\\n\\nOther main characters are Ethan, a Scotsman who owns the local grocery story, and has a romantic interest in Tova, although she doesn’t see it. A young man named Cameron comes to Sowell Bay in search of his father. He finds a job in the grocery store working for Ethan.\\n\\nAuthor Shelby Van Pelt expertly weaves the characters’ stories together. Although each character has sad emotional issues such as loss, grief, aging, and secrets, the story remains hopeful. Van Pelt keeps the secrets hidden from the reader, and the unveiling of the secrets is a reader’s joy. Marcellus has the best secrets.\\n\\nThe chapters are short which leads to the reading enjoyment along with the wonderful prose and observations. Life is sad and can be devastatingly difficult to endure, yet Van Pelt writes of the human spirit, the human need to find light and happiness.\\n\\nThis is a remarkably endearing read!',\n",

       " 'Goodreads Choice Award: Nominee for Best Fiction (2022), Nominee for Best Debut Novel (2022)\\nHopefully now it will get the attention it deserves!\\n\\n🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙\\n\\nRemarkably Bright Creatures: 11 hours 16 minutes\\nWonderfully narrated by Marin Ireland and with Michael Urie as Marcellus\\n\\n“I’d like to be…under the sea, In An Octopus’s Garden, in the shade…” 🐙 (The Beatles)\\n\\nDay 1,299 of Captivity\\n\\nThe book opens with Marcellus McSquiddles (named by the 4 year old daughter of the Aquarium’s manager) introducing himself to us with a warning that the life span of a Giant Pacific Octopus is only 4 years (1,460 days) so our time with him WILL be brief. He was “rescued” as an injured juvenile and has, at most just 160 days left, until his sentence is complete.\\n\\nCrabs, Clams, Shrimp, Scallops, Cockles, Abalones, fish and fish eggs would be his normal diet in the sea…but, he is served Mackerel, Halibut and Herring at the Sowell Bay Aquarium-MOSTLY herring due to their low cost. Ick!\\n\\nSo, you cannot blame “the guy” for escaping from his tank, overnight when something “tastier” is within reach.\\n\\nDay 1,300 of Captivity\\n\\nMarcellus almost didn’t survive the 159 days remaining.\\n\\nIf the aquarium’s oldest employee, a 70 year old cleaning lady, named Tova Sullivan hadn’t found him right as the 18 minutes he could survive outside of water was just about up, day 1,300 may have been his last.\\n\\nBecause the Octopus is a “remarkably, bright creature”-a bond is formed, but unfortunately, Tova is injured while helping the 60 pound Cephalopoda.\\n\\nTova can’t just sit home at night. Evening is the most difficult time for the widow who recently lost her husband of 47 years, and has no surviving children after losing her only son Erik, when he was just 18. So, she decides to “train” the new guy, Cameron Cassmore, who will be temporarily cleaning the Aquarium while she recovers.\\n\\nShe, (and Marcellus-who is more observant than ANY human) will find themselves involved in the mystery about what brought the “new guy” to town-JUST the stimulation a bored Octopus needed!\\n\\nI was concerned about picking up this book when it first became popular on my Goodreads feed. I didn’t want to become attached to Marcellus just to read about him getting injured or dying.\\n\\nNOT TO WORRY! The details of his final day are NOT described in this story.\\n\\nMarcellus IS the star in the way that a “supporting actor” often steals the show! He is the thread that binds the three narratives together despite having the fewest chapters.\\n\\nBut, this is just as much a story about a community, and a gentle reminder that ENDINGS also bring about new BEGINNINGS.\\n\\nSometimes you find something that you didn’t even realize you were looking for!!\\n\\nThis is a NOT TO BE MISSED delightful DEBUT that had me joyfully humming that Beatles tune for days after finishing ! AVAILABLE NOW!\\n\\nA buddy read with DeAnn! Check out her amazing review for additional thoughts!!\\n\\nThank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan of the Audible and a Physical copy of the book.

       " '4.5, rounded up\\n\\nI want suction marks on MY arm!\\n\\nYou don’t give me a huge, wise old octopus and then have him take a back seat. Well, toward the end of the book, he (our octopus named Marcellus) gets more airtime, but at the beginning I’d say his presence is a tease.\\n\\nMy favorite things were the suction marks that Marcellus made when he wrapped his tentacles around an arm of Tova, a 70-year-old janitor at an aquarium. I was jealous! Branded by an octopus, hot diggety! I know, most people wouldn’t like having suction marks all over their arm—the big purple dots would probably look like hickies. And what is an old lady doing with a bunch of hickies on her arm anyway? (Forget that fantasy, please!) But I pictured the marks as perfectly round polka dots, a beautiful and unique henna design. Tattoos to love! (I’m also assuming they didn’t hurt, of course.) No one would every guess they were suction marks made by a friendly octopus. We see lots of secrets in our lit, but come on, has anyone ever had to keep THAT kind of secret?! Imagine her spilling the beans when someone asked her what the hell those bruises on her arm were. “Oh, an octopus was wrapped around my arm for a bit. No biggie.”\\n\\nThis is the story of Tova the janitor and Marcellus the octopus, both old-timers. Don’t worry, we don’t have a talking octopus here (he and Tova don’t have conversations)—that would have been a turnoff for me. Instead, we get to hear Marcellus’s clever thoughts as he observes the humans around him. He’s a wise creature who occasionally escapes his tank in search of food treats. He’s funny and smart. (In real life, octopuses are smart—a cool fact that had me running to Google to learn more.) Oh, and Marcellus is curmudgeonly—but yet he’s also very helpful. Putting tape over my mouth because I don’t want to give anything away.\\n\\nThe story is also about a guy named Cameron, who is searching for his dad. The chapters alternate between him, Tova, and Marcellus. I loved Marcellus’s chapters the best. His observations about humans are a riot (like, why do they call him a “smart cookie”?). His chapters are short and I always wanted more; it was a jolt to move to a realistic story all of the sudden and it was always a slight comedown.\\n\\nOh, the realistic story is well done, don’t get me wrong. I loved both Tova and Cameron—both sympathetic and well-drawn. The writing is good. The plot is interesting and fast moving, but there is one huge coincidence that you have to buy into. I overlooked that the situation was unlikely because I liked the book so much. Also, the ending is a little too tight for my liking, but then again, it’s heartwarming. Who doesn’t want a feel-good ending these days?\\n\\nIt didn’t hurt that the book is set in my hood, a town near Seattle. I had to laugh—Tova doesn’t like to drive on freeways anymore. And she had to head to Bellingham, a (real) town two hours away. I’m the same age and I won’t drive on freeways anymore, either—and a friend moving to Bellingham was a disaster for me because I couldn’t drive to visit her. I loved that little similarity—funny that it was the very same town! Although Tova and I had age and a fear of freeways in common, I did not identify with her need to clean. But I can definitely see myself liking an octopus like she did.\\n\\nI realize that I like more edge, which I thought I would get, of course, with an octopus as a main character. The deal is, it’s realistic fiction with a dab of magical realism. It sort of reminds me of Kevin Wilson’s , which I loved. In Wilson’s book, we have a realistic story line, but it also happens to have kids who explode. Here, we also have a realistic story line, but it’s an octopus that’s the weird part. Marcellus reminds me a little of cool Charlotte the spider in the kids’ book, .\\n\\nI loved this book—and its bright cover—and I’ll be checking out the author’s next offering. This is a strong debut! And of course, I’ll be reading more about those smart-cookie octopuses!\\n\\nThanks to Edelweiss for an advance copy.',\n",
       " \"I'm sure many may disagree with this review, based on the love that this book has received, but I really didn't find anything special here. I found the relationship with the octopus charming but the rest of the story was very middle of the road, and achingly slow... the characters were very 2D and trite.. the boy was annoying to the point of cartoon angst.... it's interesting, but it's not groundbreaking at all\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely adored this book in all of its sappy, coincidence-ridden glory.\\n\\nListened to the audiobook narrated by the stellar Marin Ireland with a bit of help from Michael Urie as Marcellus (the Giant Pacific Octopus). If you have a choice, the audiobook is a fantastic way to experience this lovely, heartwarming book.\\n\\nTova is a seventy year old widow who lost her son many years ago and spends her nights cleaning the local aquarium. Marcellus is an octopus nearing the end of his life. He is a Remarkably Bright Creature. One night he and Tova forge a bond. Cameron is a wayward young man floating from job to job and lamenting that his mother abandoned him when he was young and never told him who his father was. When he finds a clue that leads to a man in Washington state, Cameron leaves California to go confront him.\\n\\nThis book contains one of my absolute favorite themes--found family. And one could even include Marcellus in that mix because although his role in the story isn't very large, it is certainly impactful. As I mentioned, there are a plethora of coincidences in this novel, so you'll have to set that aside to enjoy the simple beauty of the tale if those types of things bother you. Cameron has a LOT of growing up to do, which he does through the course of the novel.\\n\\nThis is overall a sweet, feel-good tale that will be sure to bring a smile to your face.\\n\\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own.\",\n",
       " 'This story begins 1,299 days after Marcellus was captured, after he’d been taken from his home and robbed of his freedom, and left in this small space, surrounded by glass walls. He’s fed, and observed through the glass that surrounds him by various people throughout the days, but he longs to return to his home. To be free. Periodically he manages somehow to escape, but is always found by Tova, who makes sure the boss isn’t aware of how often she finds him .\\n\\nTova began working there after her husband died, preferring to share her time with those who don’t ask a lot of questions, and so she and Marcellus develop a kind of silent bond. Tova shares some stories, but Marcellus can also see the sadness that weighs her down, and so periodically he will leave her small tokens. While he manages to, periodically, stray beyond his glass walls that are meant to keep him from straying, Tova’s fondness for him grows. Her affection for him grows, as does his for her.\\n\\nThis is a love story, but not your typical one.\\n\\nA new employee joins the ranks, a young man, Cameron Cassmore, who has recently arrived in search of a father he never knew, and a mother who disappeared from his life when he was young. He’s not really qualified for much, employment-wise, and so it’s up to Tova to make sure he knows what the job entails. Cameron thinks he’s there just as a maintenance worker, but he’s surprised when there’s much more to this job than mopping floors. There’s Marcellus. And Marcellus is full of surprises.\\n\\nHave I mentioned that Marcellus is a giant octopus?\\n\\nThis is a book that is touted as being for fans of , and I can see that, but for me, this reminded me more of Kevin Wilson’s - in the best way. The quirkiness, the unexpected twists and turns, and the somewhat bizarre premise that managed to completely pull me in despite how outside the box this unfolded. Filled with a quirky unconventional charm, I’ll be smiling every time I think of this story. A story that embraces the idea of love and connection across borders in every sense, and a story of family lost and found.\\n\\n\\nPublished: 03 Apr 2022\\n\\nMany thanks for the ARC provided by Ecco',\n",
       " 'When I heard the premise of this book, I imagined an octopus POV would be used as the jumping point for reflections on captivity, \"otherness\", different forms of intelligence, or respect of nature... sadly I found none of that here.\\n\\nIt\\'s just your average \"intersecting destinies\" story with a very predictable plot proceeding at a snail-like pace.\\n\\nThe writing style is similarly unremarkable. It is built from three POVs, one of which belongs to an octopus (great!), one to an unremarkable old lady (less great) and one to an absolutely insufferable, whiny man-child who talks in the kind of overly colloquial writing style (\"bicep day\\'s been lit at the gym lately\") that I really cannot stand (definitely not great).\\n\\nOverall, a waste of a good cephalopod.',\n",
       " \"As Swaye is my witness, I called this book’s ending on page four. Well, half the ending.\\n\\nAnd you probably will, too.\\n\\nThis novel isn’t out to surprise (or, if it is, that's a big fail-o-rama), save with its novel octopus POV. Mostly, it’s a bittersweet reflection on grief and aging and loneliness and family.\\n\\nAnd all of these topics are worthy of meditation.\\n\\nAs for the writing itself: some of it feels inspired, but most of it does not. Around our female lead, Tova, everything crackles and glows. The dialogue feels right. The sorrow and grit are there. Same with our octopus lead, Marcellus. But the other characters feel less fully realized.\\n\\nMy advice if you plan to read this novel: lay down any expectations of elegant prose and intricate character development in all but the two main players. And even there, don’t get crazy. This is a simple, mainstream novel, with an interesting sea creature twist. It’s a beach read, or a palette cleanser in between meatier works. Sorry, but them’s the facts.\\n\\nTwo things did during this mostly decent, if unremarkable, read. May I get them off my chest?\\n\\nFirst, Shelby Van Pelt is not a master of nuanced foreshadowing. I can’t give you specific examples, or I’ll spoil the plot, but I was bludgeoned by hints of things to come. I found myself thinking: I’m not an idiot, lady. You don’t have to hit me over the head with your clues.\\n\\nSecond, Van Pelt is absolutely in love with the word “some,” and not in a good way. Normal people probably won't trouble at this, but I get OCD with my pet peeves. Please allow me to give you three examples of how the author’s use of the word “some” drove me apeshit by story’s end:\\n\\n1. “Two clicks to download he saw a commercial about, with about guaranteeing rock-bottom prices” (104).\\n\\nSo... to clarify: do you not know which travel app he used? Or, could you not make one up?\\n\\n2. “I was watching on the travel channel the other day” (245).\\n\\nWhich show, now?\\n\\n3. “They were interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales or ” (245).\\n\\nWait, please. Were they interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales, or about “some” other “boring thing”? What exactly did this supposed interview entail, Ms. Van Pelt? You’re the only one who knows for sure, and I’d really like to be looped in.\\n\\n…\\nI’ve given you three examples here, but the author does this at least 100 times in 360 pages. I’m not exaggerating. And to me, this feels lazy. An author’s job is to create a believable world, full of believable details. Vagaries do not achieve this end, especially in such abundance.\\n\\nIn closing, I was really looking forward to reading this story, and I was mildly disappointed with it. Really, I got more pleasure from reading other people’s reviews about the novelty of an octopus narrator than I got from reading the actual book. Oh well, that’s life sometimes.\\n\\nMy consolation prize, stimulating dialogue with a savvy buddy-reader, more than makes up for this otherwise lackluster experience.\\n\\nBook/Song Pairing: Never Let Me Go (Florence + The Machine)\",\n",

She makes some difficult decisions-- such as abandoning her son --yet I never once felt let inside the emotional turmoil that surely should have caused.\\n\\nInstead, much of this novel is given over to describing the details and injustices of PACT (Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act). According to the government, the act sets out to protect American values from foreign influence (China is considered especially problematic), but what it really serves as is an excuse for racism and violence against minorities. People are being arrested for even questioning the act; children are being taken away from parents who are deemed bad influences.\\n\\nI was having a hard time for the first half of the book when we were on Bird's perspective, but I grew even more weary during Margaret's perspective when we were taken on a flashback through how she met Bird's dad and how PACT came to be.\\n\\nPerhaps I am just burned out on dystopias at this point.

Over the last three years Noah and his father Ethan, former faculty in Linguistics and currently employed in the University Library, have kept their head down, avoiding attention and dissociating themselves from Margaret, whose lines from her books of poems “Our The Missing Hearts “ was adopted by anti –PACT activists as their slogan, branding her a “traitor” in the eyes of the authorities. Given the intense Anti-Asian sentiment and discrimination and increasing incidents of violence directed toward East Asians, Bird, who is biracial, is encouraged by his father to hide his Asian roots. When Bird receives a letter with drawings reminiscent of the folktales his mother used to tell him, he embarks on a search for his missing mother- a journey that provides him not only with a greater understanding of his mother and her life as well as insight into the reasons behind his mother’s disappearance but also gives him an honest unfiltered perspective on the reality of the world around him. Needless to say, Bird’s journey as he struggles with his feelings about his mother –his hurt and longing for her gradually evolves into a deeper understanding of his parents’ love for him and a shift in his worldview - is a difficult and emotional one.\\n\\nPoignant, heartbreaking, disturbing and thought-provoking, by is a beautifully –written, powerful and timely novel that revolves around themes of family, love, sacrifice and racially motivated injustice. I finished reading this book two days ago and it’s taken me this long to gather my thoughts and pen a coherent review. This is not an easy book to read and even more difficult to review. The author paints a dark and dystopian picture of a nation where discrimination, racism and injustice are justified in the name of preservation of economic stability, culture and values. Families have been torn apart, innocent children have been forcibly taken from their homes and those working to change the narrative , build awareness and reunite families with their “missing hearts” are constantly putting their lives on the line - activists who openly protest and those who are covertly networking to trace those who been lost. The larger part of the narrative is shared from Bird’s perspective, though we do get to hear the voices of other characters as well. Unfortunately, unlike many dystopian novels, much about this book feels a bit too real at times. The author draws inspiration from past and current events which she discusses in a brilliantly penned Author’s Note. This story left me with a heavy heart.',\n",

       " 'This is the second dystopian novel I’ve read this year that is alarmingly close to reality. Celeste Ng’s “Our Missing Hearts” is a story centered around children who have been separated from their parent for political reasons. In Ng’s world, the government can seize children from parents if alleged “subversive” behavior is exposed to children in the home. Ng also adds a xenophobic element of anti-Asian sentiments, especially regarding China. We all know how real that became during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn Ng’s world, “The Crisis” occurred from a worldwide economic breakdown caused by the Chinese, as opposed to the pandemic. Bird Gardner is a twelve-year-old boy, being raised by his father. His mother disappeared after her poetry was deemed provocative against the State. Bird has a best friend, Sadie, who also was removed from her family. Bird’s father does not permit Bird to even mention his mother. All Bird remembers is that his mother loved cats.\\n\\nPACT (The Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act) is a code of conduct aimed at protecting America. What happens is censorship. Ng shows the slippery slope of government over-reach. She shows how when racism is allowed unchecked, our lives ultimately end in fear for all.\\n\\nEarlier this year, 2022, Jessamine Chan wrote “The School for Good Mothers” which had a similar theme of government over-reach. Chan’s novel focused on the mothers, how the mothers coped once their children were taken away. In Ng’s story, the focus is on the children, how confusing the world is to children who have their family stability ripped away in the name of politics.\\n\\nAt the end of the novel, Ng wrote that children have been removed from parents throughout history in the name of politics. We are separating children from their parents at our boarders. Social Services can take children away. Indigenous children across the world were taken away and placed in state-run boarding schools. During war, children are separated from their parents.\\n\\nWhile there is good reason in many cases when children need protection, especially from physical violence, we as a society must remain vigilant. Ng’s story also shows the impact of racism and bigotry and the danger in allowing those ideals to settle in politics.\\n\\nA very clever ending involving performance art provided a powerful statement in nonviolent protests. I love Ng’s prose. She uses her voice/pen to improve humanity.\\n\\nI listened to the audio narrated by Lucy Liu. She did a fabulous job.',\n",
       " 'Thank you to Penguin Press for the early copy for review!\\n\\nOnce again Celeste Ng has written a stunning, evocative novel about what it means to be human and how our actions impact the lives of others.\\n\\nSet in a world very similar to ours, Our Missing Hearts follows a 12 year old boy named Noah \"Bird\" Gardner whose mother, a revolutionary poet is on the run after lines from her poetry are used to oppose a government policy called PACT. PACT enforces a sort of hyper-nationalism, encouraging American citizens to look out for a report any activity that might be deemed suspicious, particularly focused on actions of Asian-American citizens. In this world, the rise of China as a superpower threatens not only the USA\\'s economy but also their pride and place as a superpower on the world\\'s stage.\\n\\nBird lives with his father who is a librarian on a college campus. It\\'s been 3 years since Bird\\'s mother has gone missing when he gets a mysterious letter in the mail one day. From there, Bird sets off on a journey to uncover the secrets of his mother\\'s past and hopefully discover what became of her fate.\\n\\nCeleste Ng is a good writer. I could not put this book down! From page one, I was hooked. She blends literary, character-driven stories with a compelling, page-turning plot. I absolutely fell in love with Bird as a character and was so intrigued by the world Ng had created; this sort of near-dystopian world but one that felt all too similar to our own in 2022. It\\'s clear Ng drew from real historical events, much like Atwood did for .\\n\\nThe story itself is incredibly interesting. I was so curious to find out more, and the characters you meet along the way really fill out the story in a nice way. I enjoyed them all and was eager to keep reading to find out what would happen.\\n\\nMy only critique is that by the end, I was ever so slightly underwhelmed. I don\\'t honestly know how else she could have ended it, so I am not trying to be overly critical of this fact, because I think it does work. I think, however, in comparison to Ng\\'s other two novels, this one just sort of fizzled out for me as opposed to having a punchy, compelling ending. I do think that over time, there is a lot to think about with this one and I definitely could see myself reading it again in the future. I think that says a lot about the story and writing.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a great reading experience! I have loved, and suspect I will continue to love, everything Celeste Ng has written and cannot wait to see what she does next.',\n",
       " 'Ms.Ng has written a cautionary tale for our times. It is very obvious that she has poured her heart into this novel and I thank her for that.\\n\\nI wanted to love this book but there were too many plot holes and other problems that I had with this book.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nI enjoyed the first half of the book a lot more than the second. I felt hopeful that there was some good change coming in the second half.\\n\\nI was constantly looking forward to what was going to be the impetus to change things.\\n\\nI loved the character of Bird. Even when he was young he was always looking for answers as to why his mother had left them. He never gave up his love for her and wanting to find her.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nThey never really did answer \"how\" this drastic change happened besides mentioning a bill that was passed. I know this is dystopian but I just couldn\\'t envision it.\\n\\nWhat exactly was The Crisis? Since this is what changed everything I think there should have been more explanation\\n\\nHow did they brainwash everyone into thinking taking the children away from Chinese Americans would accomplish anything?\\n\\nOne of the biggest questions was never answered -- where are they taking these children? What are they doing with them?\\n\\nThere was a lot of \"telling\" rather than \"showing\" especially in the second half.\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS: I think the author has a great message and a reminder to keep watch at what is going on around us. A cautionary tale for sure. Horrible things have happened in the past and we should never forget that!\\n\\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.',\n",
       " 'Lately it’s felt like the world we’re living in is unstable, with the war in Europe and the lock-down we just had. Reading our missing hearts increased that feeling. I know there are countries where propaganda happens, and the book managed to convey how that might form us convincingly. I liked that we saw the world through Bird’s eyes. It was authentic and increased the unease I felt. It’s also a beautiful description of a mother-child relationship, and the hard choices we can be faced with.',\n",
       " 'Actual Rating: 2.5/5 stars\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you. But only if you promise to remember. That she was a real person, not a poster. That she was a child. My child.\"\\n\\nAfter a 5-year hiatus following Little Fires Everywhere, Celeste Ng returns with a venture into the dystopian. Being a fan of her contemporary, closeknit family stories, I was highly anticipating what Ng would do with this larger scope and premise. Although the bones of what makes Ng such a great author were there, I found this her weakest work to date. Long review incoming.\\n\\n\\nNg imagines a future America frighteningly close to our own. After The Crisis brought financial and- political instability to the country, the American government has responded with the introduction of the Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act (PACT). A law intended to bring back days of former glory, instead lead to the mistrust and repression of cultural minorities and the silencing of their voices in the form of art and writing.\\nWe follow Bird, a 12-year old Chinese-American boy who’s life has been affected by PACT in many ways. Above all, it led to him growing up without his mother Margret Miu, who became a political fugitive after her poem “Our Missing Hearts” sparked an accidental anti-PACT movement. With all her works being governmentally shredded and all trace of her removed, Bird has no way of knowing what faith befell his mother. That is until a letter arrives, containing the first clue into a daring quest to locate her.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that there’s an important topic and message here that deserves attention, and I command any effort to speak up about it. More on this in the Ugly-section however.\\nThere is no way for me to speak to the substantive portrayal of the Chinese-American experience, and I highly encourage reading own-voices reviews for that over mine. I speak to the way in which the story was told. The thing that stands out most was Celeste Ng signature beautiful writing, that guided us through the story. Unfortunately, her other strengths as a writer were less so on display in this one.\\n\\n\\nThe main appeal to Ng’s previous work was her character work, which unfortunately didn’t live up to standards in . The main characters were flat as a pamphlet on which the books message was distributed. Margaret makes some questionable parenting choices “in favour of the greater good”, but I felt none of her internal conflict about it. Instead, she’s portrayed as a one-dimensional good-character; a reluctant face of a revolution for us to root for.\\nSimilarly with Bird; this 12-year old boy is put through quite the ordeal, yet is all too mature and mellow about the whole thing. For the longest time, there is no resentment towards his mother, no anger, no fear. You can make the argument for keeping a brave face, but with us as the reader being in his head for most of the novel, hist internal struggle would’ve helped greatly to bring these characters to life and make them less of a blank slate.\\n“Lifeless” is also the (harsh) word I’d use to describe the worldbuilding; although you can tell there was a lot of thought behind it, the world never came to life off the page. Mostly, this was due to a of telling and absolutely no showing. Pages upon pages were filled with explanations and background on the founding and actions of PACT, yet throughout most of the story absolutely nothing occurs on page to back it. This is aggravated by some pacing-issues where the plot doesn’t kick off until about the 50%-mark, only to take up tumbling speed from there on. The disconnect and the slower pace put this book at risk for being DNF-ed before the halfway mark…\\n\\n\\nThere is no way for me to talk about the true reason this book disappointed me, without broadening the scope to “dystopia’s” in general. The genre has become quite overpopulated lately, with novel after novel piggy-backing off the same themes, whilst bringing nothing new to the table. This started with the Margaret-Atwood-lookalikes a few years ago, but has since spread to include tales of police-violence and racism in America. Where I am all for raising awareness and battling these horrid injustices, I feel like that’s no longer what’s happening. Within the last years, these topics have become commercialized and used as “buzz-words” to sell books. I have a problem with.\\nIt’s also my ultimate problem with . It’s another brick in the dystopian wall; a well-meant contribution to a valiant cause, but a quite commercial and safe one within an already saturated genre. The titular slogan was a perfect example of accidental activism and (intentionally!) echoes real-life examples such as the famous “I can’t breathe”. I wanted Celeste Ng to go there; to have that conversation with us. What I didn’t want was this sanitized, commercialised story, written for the mass-appeal of a bestseller-list, under the veil of “raising awareness”. Authors, readers, anyone… if we want these things to change, it’s time to make a change and rock the boat. Not too rehash and reread the same safe stuff over and over again, whilst making no moves forward in the process.\\n\\nMany thanks to Little Brown UK for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.',\n",

       " '\"Racism is man\\'s gravest threat to man - the maximum of hatred for a minimum of reason.\"-Abraham Joshua Heschel\\n\\nPowerful, prescient, and poignant, this dark, dystopian novel felt a LITTLE too close to reality!\\n\\nTwelve year old Bird simply goes by Noah now. He hasn\\'t used his true name in many years, because his parents feel it isn\\'t safe. He lives a somewhat solitary existence with his father, a university librarian, after Bird\\'s mother flew the coop (so to speak) when he was 9. As a Chinese American poet who didn\\'t shy away from any subject, his mother Margaret was one of many targets of the PACT-The Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act. This \\'new way of life\\' sprang up as a result of The Crisis, a time of severe economic and social decline...which was been almost solely blamed on China, and subsequently, Chinese Americans have also taken the fall.\\n\\nThis new reality is soulless and lonely, with \\'dangerous\\' books plucked off of library shelves (and turned into toilet paper rather than burned...because this is somehow seen as a better alternative!) and children are constantly being relocated if their family seems too close to the anti-PACT faction. Bird still longs to know what has happened to his mother and when the name of her most famous poem \"Our Missing Hearts\" is painted by protestors on the street, Bird has a feeling things are about to come to a head...and he\\'s right. He receives a mysterious message with an address in New York and knows that he needs to pursue this lead and discover JUST what happened to his mother...but what will he find? Can he make the journey...and is it worth the risk?\\n\\nFirst off, it\\'s been a while since we\\'ve heard from Ng and it\\'s clear she had this book cooking for some time. There are shades of many of the tragedies and injustices that have come to light over the past 4 years in the United States referenced here, and in some respects, this book may have served as an outlet to process some of this trauma. I\\'m a fan of Ng\\'s, so I\\'ll admit I added this book to my must-read list without having ANY idea of how heavy it is... There are basically zero moments of levity throughout...something I can\\'t even say for the Handmaid\\'s Tale (although in and of itself, it\\'s obviously pretty bleak in its own right).\\n\\nIf you\\'re going in looking for the twisted family dynamics and the murder-mystery type angle you can find in and , you will find that here. Ng makes her focus clear from the beginning, and this book is much more about world-building and what can happen if we let things escalate and continue down the dangerous path they are already headed rather than these specific characters themselves.\\n\\nThis is not to say the characters aren\\'t impactful or lovable in their own way. The first half of the book is dominated by Bird, the second by Margaret, and both characters Make Their Mark...but perhaps in a more understated way than some of Ng\\'s previous characters. The second half of the book apparently omits quotation marks (?) which is something I must admit I didn\\'t even notice until I glanced at a couple of other reviews after I finished reading... The pacing drags a bit going through the machinations of how PACT came to be and Margaret\\'s backstory...but for me, the detail and the intricacy was interesting and worthwhile. The last couple chapters from Margaret, in particular, got me wholly caught up in emotion, so whether this plot stands up to the \\'typical\\' dystopian novel or not?\\n\\n\\n\\nNg hooked me, line and sinker, and I was captivated until the bitter end. To cap it off, Ng has a FANTASTIC author\\'s note that is both detailed and heartfelt, where she explains much of the research she did to write the novel and offers sources for her readers to take a deep dive as well. I don\\'t know as though I\\'ll be emotionally ready to handle it for a while (hence the reason why it took me a while to even sit down and pen this review), but the content is there and ready to be explored.\\n\\nThis is a multi-faceted and thought-provoking book, and PERFECT for discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 stars',\n",
       " 'Our Missing Hearts by Celeste Ng is a 2022 Penguin Press publication.\\n\\nI had such trust in Ng that I downloaded this book without hesitation… and without reading the synopsis. My faith was tested when I finally settled in to read this book. I don’t like dystopian novels. I don’t read much science fiction- which is the way this book is categorized. I cringed, uncertain of how this was going to work out for me. But, I already had the book and this is Celeste Ng, after all, so I soldiered on and hoped for the best...\\n\\nThe story is set in a time after a ‘The Crisis’- after certain laws have been passed to protect America from those being blamed for said crisis. In this world, Margaret, a Chinese American poet, is blamed for stirring up protestors – so for the sake of her son, Bird, she goes into hiding, before they can take him away.\\n\\nBird is being raised by his father, who goes along with everything the government requires. He’s lost his position, and his home, and works in a library now. He keeps his head down and does his best to protect his son, by disavowing all his wife stood for.\\n\\nThey shuffle along day in and day out, avoiding conflict or trouble, flying under the radar, until one day Bird gets a message from his mother, one that stirs up memories and longing, and creates an urgent need to find her. His quest is a dangerous one, but it may be the journey that finally sets him free…\\n\\nMy concerns about the categorization of this book were unwarranted. This is an incredible novel- heartbreaking, terrifying, but ultimately empowering. There are silences and complicity- but there is also great strength and courage in these passages.\\n\\nIn a year when every social issue under the sun is crammed inside of every single book- from cozies to romance, to historical fiction, horror, and all points in between, I feared this book might be padded a bit too heavily, and at times Ng did overplay her hand. But the story still serves as a cautionary tale, as a reminder to be vigilant, to be on your guard, to rise to the occasion, though it is not the easiest path to take.\\n\\nThe book is so well-written, with much thought behind it, I could literally feel the oppression leaping off the pages, the fear palpable, but I also felt it ease, as hope eventually settles in, despite the bleakness of the moment.\\n\\nThat said, after reading so many ‘message books’ this year- not by choice for the most part, I don’t think I felt the full impact of this novel as I might have if I’d read it at the end of 2021, or earlier this year. It’s a dark, reflective novel, and one I might revisit someday, after my head is relieved of such weighty topics for a while.\\n\\nOverall, I can’t say this is my favorite novel by this author- at least not right now- but I appreciate what she was going for, and thought she did a brilliant job at creating the world in which the story transpires and the truths behind the dystopian style fantasy. Ng is a great writer, and once again I walk away deeply impressed with her talents.\\n\\n4 stars',\n",

I love the voice of this story, a relatively distant, straightforward third-person POV. Bird is a 12 yr old boy, very innocent yet precocious/insightful. Because he's describing a harrowing world, his relative innocence is both refreshing and frightening, similar to Ishiguro's Klara and the Sun (matter-of-fact narration by an artificial being) and Javier Zamora's Solito (memoir written from the perspective of a 9-year old boy making the difficult journey from El Salvador to the US by himself to join his parents). The themes Ng explores are similar to her previous books--the insidiousness of racism (especially in a biracial family), a mother's estrangement from her family, the impact of that on her children, a small community being torn apart--but this book feels bigger, more political, more an artist frustrated with the world she's living in.

       " \"The concept and politics behind this dystopian novel were thought-provoking and challenging. But for me Ng's previous two novels using family drama to draw out themes of prejudice and racism were far more powerful.\\n\\nThe narrative for much of this book felt too much like the author wanted to download all her political feelings surrounding race issues in the US into her reader's minds at the expense of building on captivating characters and compelling plot.\\n\\nBecause a large part of the plot was conveyed through conversation explaining retrospective experience it left me a little cold. I couldn't engage with the events of the story as they were shared in quite a spare, summarative way from one character to another. I couldn't find a way into the emotion of it all despite the very sad atrocities of what was happening in this dystopian world and indeed, has sadly taken place in many countries in the real world. Yet, I just felt too distant from it all and found the plot ploddy and uninspiring.\\n\\nNg's prose is still beautiful and the use of language is stunning at times, but I didn't enjoy this anywhere near as much as her previous two novels.\\n\\nThis honest review is given with thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for this book.\",\n",
       " \"You often hear people exclaim “I would read anything that (insert author name) writes!” – but when it comes to Celeste Ng, it really is true for me. \\n\\nOur Missing Hearts is a dystopian novel, a genre I haven’t really touched since my teenage dystopian phase when I was obsessed with The Hunger Games and Divergent. But because Ng is such a skilled storyteller and her writing is so compelling, that really wasn’t an issue for me here. With all 3 of Ng’s books that I’ve read, it’s only taken the first few pages for me to be pulled into the story. \\n\\nfollows 12-year-old Bird, who is now living a quiet life with his white father after his Chinese American mother, Margaret Miu, left them years ago. In the wake of a recent financial crisis, the novel’s conceptualisation of America now operates under PACT (Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act), a government act which sets out to defend American values from foreign influences (especially from China), allowing for arrests and children being separated from their parents if people even dare to question the act.  \\n\\nBird has never stopped wondering about his mother and where she is, but due to the jingoistic and racist society left by PACT, he has always been instructed to keep his head down and stay out of trouble, mostly by supressing his Asian identity. \\n\\nEssentially, is among the slew of Covid response novels which have been released since 2020, offering a clear allegory of the political turmoil and racial tensions during the pandemic, particularly Anti-Asian rhetoric and the myth of the ‘Chinese virus’. (Although focusing on Black people, 's essay ‘Contempt As a Virus’ on structural racism being the real virus in America would be a great companion to this novel.) \\n\\nThe novel’s exploration of children being removed from ‘unpatriotic’ families echoes both a current and historical tradition in America – ICE separating children from their families at the border and placing them in cages, indigenous children taken away to boarding schools to be ‘civilised’ into Euro-American culture and values, and many more examples.\\n\\nIn this way, Ng’s portrait of America is very much rooted in its history, which alarmingly just makes its ‘dystopian future’ feel not too far away.  \\n\\nis a novel which is lyrically written, incredibly powerful, and disturbingly relevant.\\n\\n—————————\\n\\nthe queen of literary fiction has done it again\",\n",
       " 'binged this in two sittings yet the ending has left me wanting to punch a hole in my wall 😂😂😂 leaving off a rating for now until i sit with it more. but to be honest, the subject matter makes it a bit hard to rate.\\n\\nis this an amazing 5-star book? for me, no. but is it a perfect book club book? absolutely. Reese hit it on the head with yet another pick. you can talk about this books for hours and debate the ending and the topics until you’re blue in the face.\\n\\nthis book was heavy and dark and set in a bleak dystopian future with little happy moments so beware of that going in. if you like ambiguous endings and things left up to individual interpretation, then you’ll enjoy it. if you don’t, then you might be left disappointed.\\n\\nall that said, this book covers a ton of heavy topics and has so much to unpack. dystopian fiction can be a bit much, and this one was definitely super heavy and emo. if you’re a mother, i think you can connect to this more than non-mothers. simply put, it’s basically about one mother and what she’ll do to protect her child and help make a difference in the world.\\n\\nit reminded me a bit of A SCHOOL FOR GOOD MOTHERS. so many “wtf” moments that could make you fearful for the future or determined to not let it get to that. lots of current themes to our messy world right now which might be too much for people to read—racism, children separated from families, discrimination, book banning, violence, repercussions if you don’t believe in a specific thing, lack of free info, etc.\\n\\noh, and it’s a SUUUUPER slow burn. the first 1/3 was setting the stage. the middle was a bit slow. and the last 1/3 had me super invested—until that final chapter 😅\\n\\nTLDR; a perfect book club discussion but the ending might make you scream 😂\\n\\nPS—the audiobook was MUCH better than the physical for this one. the no quotation marks was messing w me too much!',\n",
       " 'This book can be summed up with one phrase: tell me you don’t know how the government works without telling me you don’t know how the government works.\\n\\nI had a NUMBER of issues with this book, but the most egregious one is Ng throws around DANGEROUS comparisons and shallow analyses on her quest to discuss thematically heavy topics. Like Kuang, Ng wants to highlight the plight of Asian immigrants in society and how various societies consider them a danger and “other” to the point of discrimination.\\n\\nBut she did a criminal job of believably conveying that idea. To start, her world was NOT fleshed out. Her nebulous claim that this world “is not our own but is one or two degrees separate” was apparently her way of excusing herself from actually describing her world in any meaningful way. There were vague references to some “economic collapse” that happened “slowly then all at once, as these things often do.” Normally, I quite enjoy Ng’s flowery prose and poetic descriptions for seemingly common settings, but in this case it came off as lazy. She never gave us an actual REASON her society collapsed, only that everyone lost their jobs and no one had any money and this was “blamed on China” without actually delving into the nuances of great power competition and instead painting a shallow picture that makes America out to be a one dimensional racist character which, to be fair, we ARE. But because Ng didn’t actually TELL us anything compelling, I found the insistence of these fictional political leaders just randomly blaming China and insinuating they were doing it for purely racist tendencies just….lazy.\\n\\nEven worse, in the face of this economic devastation, instead of enacting Great Depression era reforms or even 2008 Recession financial incentives, this government just….. passed an act claiming everyone has to be a patriot???? How on EARTH was that supposed to fix the economic crisis??? Even worse, Ng then sums up what was apparently a decade of chaos and depression and starvation by saying “once PACT was passed, businesses slowly started coming back” AS IF BY PASSING A LAW SAYING CHINA SUCKS BUSINESSES SUDDENLY FOUND FREE MONEY ON THE GROUND??? Where was the planning?? Where was the commentary on how it was actually China who devalued US businesses therefore leading to the economic collapse? Where was evidence of actual Chinese aggression in US society that led to a bear market thus sending our stock market into a tumble? Let me tell you where these things were: NOT IN THIS BOOK. America is just racist and hates the Chinese and \"anyone who looks like them\" and once the government assured us they were eradicating \"the China problem\" all the businesses suddenly came back from hibernation and people had money again and also the job market was booming. Yeah ok.\\n\\nMaybe I’m biased because I actually know how both the government and also money in the government works, but this novel came off as pandering to the neoliberal audience that has seemed to invade bookish spaces lately. This book would have been far more powerful a commentary on race relations in the US if the setting Ng created was more believable. Her constant reinforcement in her author’s note, interviews, and blurbs insisting that this world “closely mirrors our own” was so painfully inaccurate that I had a hard time focusing on the book itself because I was just so angry at the audacity.\\n\\nShe could have tied this back to the internment camps, the Chinese Exclusion Act, literally ANYTHING except “white people hate Asians for no reason.” This rubbed me the wrong way even more because CHINA IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM. Specifically, the PRC government IS in fact a direct threat to our national security!!! They do in fact manipulate the market to the detriment of DOZENS of impoverished countries around the world!!!!! They regularly employ predatory investment screening and lending practices to those who have no other choice but to comply with their exorbitant terms of contract and then Hoover up properties and ports and entire countries like a vacuum all to serve the motherland. THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. And Ng conflating the very real threat China poses to US national security with racism that Asian Americans face in this country FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS was irresponsible at best, dangerous at worst. I could dive into the reasons people use China as their bogeyman and how it’s inaccurate in most cases, but I paid 100k for the degree that taught me that and I’m not interested in discussing that for free on this website, so feel free to google actual COGENT analyses on “the China problem” before accepting that if we criticize their very real and problematic threats to this country, we’re somehow racists. New flash, saying that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians isn’t anti semitic the same way that saying the PRC is a threat to US national security isn’t racist against Asians.\\n\\nIf Ng had put more effort into creating a believable atmosphere instead of imparting a watered down thematic concept, this book would have been better.\\n\\n*EDIT 2/12/23*\\nI think it’s worth clarifying here in the review that I actually DO believe AAPI discrimination in America is a real and legitimate problem. I also believe America is always the racist aggressor 9.9/10 times and I frequently refer to us as the colonizers because we are. But I think Ng conflated that very real and prevalent issue plaguing society with an unlike comparison and didn’t contextualize or characterize her world nearly enough to make this link convincing in her novel setting. Not that racism ever has a justifiable cause; as an Iranian American woman in a society that vilifies not only Iranians but Muslims and Arabs and anyone from the Middle East generally and who does NOT get any awareness raising for this plight, trust me, I know racism is a faceless and reasonless monster. But I found Ng’s implied reliance on our assumption that “of course they blame China for no reason because white people are racist” as the ENTIRE basis for her society bad writing. It didn’t invoke the necessary feeling we needed to become emotionally attached to the characters so we could feel properly incensed at the mindless and senseless acts of racism in the book; this laziness is ultimately why I felt more resentment that I was reading such a shitty book rather than the outrage I should have felt reading about the collapse of society.',\n",

Twenty years older and a self-made success, Frank's life is full of all the excesses Cleo's lacks. He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint, and the opportunity to apply for a Green Card.

Whether it's Cleo's best friend struggling to embrace his gender queerness in the wake of Cleo's marriage, or Frank's financially dependent sister arranging sugar daddy dates to support herself after being cut off, or Cleo and Frank themselves as they discover the trials of marriage and mental illness, each character is as absorbing, and painfully relatable, as the last.\\n\\nAs hilarious as it is heartbreaking, entertaining as it is deeply moving, Cleopatra and Frankenstein marks the entry of a brilliant and bold new talent.\",\n",

       " \"Other Birds by Sarah Addison Allen\\n\\nI don't always know what to think of stories that deal with magical realism but this one is a winner for me. The Dellawisps are the tiny turquoise birds that the five unit, well hidden, apartment building in Mallow Island, South Carolina, is named after. This birds inhabit the courtyard garden of the apartment complex, and they can be found around and on the apartment manager, Frasier, too. These little birds seem to have a lot to say, strong opinions about everything, and are every bit as scary, for some folks, as they are tiny.\\n\\nNineteen year old Zoey has just arrived at the apartment complex so that she can inhabit her late mother's studio apartment. Her mother died when she was seven and she's lived a lonely life since that time. Her father is wealthy, wanted little to do with her even though she lived in his home, and neither did the woman he married after Zoey's mom's death. It was as if her dad, stepmother, and her two step siblings were waiting for her to finally move out of their house so they could really be a family without her intrusion in their lives.\\n\\nAll the residents and the manager of the property have hurts and longings that keep them from living their lives fully. They are lonely and sad and try to hide these feelings but instead they wear them like a cloak they can't take off. One resident, an intrusive, angry, bitter lady, dies as soon as Zoey moves in and she can't help being interested in this woman. Frasier asks Zoey to go through her apartment to find some missing papers and to clean the hoarded mess of this woman. Another neighbor, Charlotte, helps Zoey and despite Charlotte's fear of befriending and trusting anyone, these women become close. And there is the big, redheaded chef, Mac, who has his own hurts and secrets. Another resident is Lucy, the dead woman's sister, who is so reclusive that Zoey never sees her because the woman won't leave her apartment during the light of day.\\n\\nThis is such a sweet story, as these people come together and learn to give and learn to love. So much more makes a family than blood ties. There is so much more to belonging than having the same last name as others. And just because you can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist and isn't real.

Other than everyone\\'s \\'witch balls\\' getting broken, I think they could have been erased from the book almost entirely without affecting much.\\n\\nTo me, the 288 pages felt long...but at the same time, I think doing more of a deep dive on these characters would have been welcome. There were also some shocking secrets that were revealed randomly at the end of a chapter and then either a) not mentioned again in any sort of significant way or b) not expanded on the way I think they could have been in a longer book. Some of the sections also read a bit YA to me, and while this worked in a sense for Zoey\\'s character, I also think it detracted from the overall gravitas of the book.\\n\\nIt is clear Sarah Addison Allen is a thoughtful and intelligent writer and very dedicated to the craft. I was so impressed with certain parts of the book that I would stop and question if I had just been feeling disengaged momentarily and if I WOULD end up loving this book. Sad to say, within a chapter or two I would end up where I started, but if I was the type to highlight lines in a book, this would be a prime candidate. I can understand why Allen has such devoted fans and I truly wish I\\'d fallen under her spell too!\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 stars',\n",
       " 'A lonely, isolated young woman looking for remnants of her mother’s life, a place to belong, moves to a quiet island off the coast of South Carolina . On Mallow Island she connects with several other residents of the condo she has inherited. All of them are looking for something more in their lives. If you are not willing to accept a little bit of the imaginary, you might want to skip this book, but you’d be missing out on a sweet story of friendship and hope, a feel good story. It’s not that this is a totally light read, but it does provide some respite from the full reality of some of distressing things happening around us.\\n\\nI get that magical realism is not for everyone and a steady diet of it doesn’t work for me, but once in a while this kind of story feels just right. This is one of those stories with an invisible pet pigeon, ghosts and birds that inhabit the place. This sad sack cast of characters pulled me into their quirky lives. Caring about them made it easy to suspend my disbelief for just awhile, long enough to enjoy this story and long enough to remember them, I’m sure.\\n\\nI might have passed up this book if it wasn’t for my friend Diane’s wonderful review.

       " 'What a sweet story!\\n\\nSarah Addison Allen has reminded me once again why I love Magical Realism so much. How can I not love a book whose main character has an invisible bird named Pigeon and who resides in a condo complex with several ghosts and some curious little turquoise birds called dellawisps? It’s not really a question, because of course I’m going to love that!! Like TJ Klune, Allen captures the human spirit so well in a way that both charms and makes you feel for all the characters, while gently giving focus to some pretty heavy topics - in this case childhood trauma and healing old wounds.\\n\\nNineteen-year-old college student Zoe Hennessy has just inherited her late mother’s Mallow Island condo off the coast of South Carolina, managed by friendly but mysterious, Frasier, and is a new neighbor to four other residents of The Dellawisp: executive chef Mac, henna artist Charlotte, resident busybody/hoarder Lizbeth Lime, and Lizbeth’s estranged and reclusive sister, Lucy Lime. At first glance, they’re a rag-tag group with little in common, but after an event happens that slowly draws these residents closer together, you see just how similar they really are. It’s the newly formed friendships and each character’s gradually revealed backstory that give this book its heart and depth, and by the end I loved all these characters.\\n\\nZoe is an energetic ball of charm who’s determined to bring these virtual strangers together, if she can get her often petulant invisible bird, Pigeon, to stop interfering. It’s sweet to watch her friendship with Charlotte grow and, in turn, their friendships with Mac, though the Lime sisters are another issue. I cheered for each character as they confronted the traumas of their past and opened their guarded hearts to each other. The budding romances were also handled with a light hand, so they felt very pure and sweet!\\n\\nMy main difficulty with the story was that it was a bit heavy-handed on the bad parenting theme, which made it a little less believable, but then again, Frasier did say the residents were picked for a reason, so I guess the similar backgrounds were intentional? The ending went a teeny bit OTT for me as well. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this, I love her writing, and there were some fabulous unexpected twists that I didn’t see coming! I highly recommend this lovely story and I’ll definitely watch for more from this author!\\n\\n★★★★ ½\\n\\nThanks to St. Martin’s Press, NetGalley and author Sarah Addison Allen for this ARC to honestly review.

       " '\"Other Birds\" by Sarah Addison Allen is a perfect blend of Friendship Fiction and Magical Realism!\\n\\nCarrying Pigeon in her birdcage, Zoey Hennessey has arrived at her new home left to her by her late mother years ago. In the coastal town of Mellow Island, S.C., her condo is part of a secluded cobblestone building known as \\'THE DELLAWISP\\'. It\\'s named after the tiny turquoise birds that inhabit the island, the trees, and the air surrounding the small, private complex. A wrought iron gate is the only entrance and, along with the wispy birds, makes it feel like a secret, magical place.\\n\\nZoey is shown to her loft studio by the manager, Frazier, an elderly black man with a long white beard gathered and tied at his chin in the fashion of a pirate. He describes her new neighbors: Charlotte Lungren, a henna artist; Mac Garrett, an executive chef; Lucy Lime, a reclusive and her sister Lizbeth Lime, who Zoey meets briefly and surmises her to be brash but mostly confused. She wonders if the other neighbors are as...quirky!\\n\\nSitting on the balcony past midnight, the humid air feels thick and oddly still to Zoey. She knows all her neighbors are home now as she hears Pigeon land on her birdcage inside and cooing for Zoey to come in, too. Zoey feels a chill go through her and has a peculiar feeling that something is about to happen.\\n\\nInside, moments later, she hears a heavy thump from one of the apartments below that\\'s startling. She sees Mac go outside and knows he heard it, too!\\n\\nSomething just happened! Something strange...\\n\\nThis is the first Sarah Addison Allen book I\\'ve read and it exceeds my expectations. This author creates characters that are quietly imperfect, solitary by choice or circumstance, painfully broken, and drawn together in one place for reasons beyond their control. Each is fearful of secrets from their past that leach out slowly to the reader through their backstories. Each is hoping for a brighter, worry free future.\\n\\nThe Magical Realism kicks in early and feels like wind chimes sound in a delicate breeze, soft, sweet, and soothing. That\\'s what makes this story fun and easy to read because without the whimsical aspects, the character\\'s stories may break your heart and bring you to tears. The author does a thoughtful job with this balancing act in her writing, which is light, simple, and carries you along as it flows so smoothly and gently through the story. It reminds me of a conversation you would have with a close friend.\\n\\nThere is a mystery within the pages of this book, but to me, this is more about the lives of the characters, the magic of those living and the memories of those in-between.\\n\\nTrue to a Southern setting, there\\'s food mingled in to comfort and satisfy the soul. Another plus for this Reader who lives in the South and is also a Foodie! I highly recommend this thought provoking read that makes me ravishingly hungry to dig into this author\\'s backlist!\\n\\n4.5 stars rounded up to 5 \\'beautiful dellawisp\\' stars!\\n\\nThank you to NetGalley, St. Martin\\'s Press, and Sarah Addison Allen for an ARC of this book. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review.',\n",
       " \"She wanted chaos......\\n\\nLike so many, many others who breathe it in in order to reassemble the inner turmoil that festers there. With a constant shift in the air, it forced an unexpected response. A subtle presence of one who inevitably lights the way and calms the storm.\\n\\nSarah Addison Allen presents a novel structured with human building blocks. We will be introduced to shadows of individuals, both real and perhaps not, who fill these pages with doubt, fear, rejection, grief and tiny fragments of simple love in all forms. Allen wishes for us to slowly make their acquaintance before instantly reacting with surface judgments so ingrained in the human psyche.\\n\\nZoey Hennessey, on the cusp of nineteen, is relocating from Tulsa to Mallow Island off the South Carolina coast. Autumn will bring her to college in Charleston. But for now, Zoey just wants to embrace her mother's memory in Paloma's condo that she has inherited on the island. Zoey has traveled with her pet pigeon, Pigeon, who brings her comfort. But there's other baggage that Zoey carries from her former life. In spite of it all, Zoey searches out connection wherever she lands.\\n\\nWe'll meet the other residents of Dellawisp Condos including the turquoise blue birds that fly freely throughout the grounds. Frasier, the manager, runs a tight ship. The other occupants are as varied as the shells on the shore. They are all clinging to their privacy with two being reclusive. But it is Zoey's nature to seek out the ticking stories held within. Frasier hires Zoey to sort through boxes upon boxes in one of the condos of the reclusive who just passed away. Zoey will uncover unexpected treasures from an unexpected tomb.\\n\\nSarah Addison Allen uncovers unifying concepts in her host of characters. Their lives stem from the bizarre to the tragic to the unexplainable. And they all circle dance around the deepest desire to be loved and to be accepted in the scheme of things. Other Birds is a gift from this author to see what can't readily be seen and to experience a life without self-imposed limitations. A honey of a read.\\n\\nI received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to St. Martin's Press and to Sarah Addison Allen for the opportunity.\",\n",

       " 'Not rating!\\n\\nI was wanting to try some magical realism, but at 25% I realize this isn’t for me!\\n\\nMagical Realism is style of literary fiction and art. It paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality.

Plus, the main character, Zoey Hennessey, is a plucky protagonist, in search of remnants of her deceased mother.\\n\\nThe story opens with Zoey arriving at a remote tiny island off the coast of South Carolina named Mallow Island. Zoey’s mother, Paloma, owns a condo there secreted in the middle of town where Zoey intends to stay. She came for the summer to attempt to find information about her mother, who died years ago. Zoey brings an empty bird cage which holds her imaginary bird, Pigeon. The condo building is horseshoe-shaped, and maintained by an elderly man named Frasier who is written like Saint Francis because of the turquoise dellawisp birds that follow him.\\n\\nSoon after Zoey’s arrival, one of the residents, Lizbeth, is found dead.

Zoey has memories of this place, memories of when she was there with her mother as a child, but that was long ago.

       " \"It's been such a long time since I've picked up a novel by SAA and I was so hoping that OTHER BIRDS would feel like so many of this author's previous works -- magical, delicious, and full of wonder. And while there is some deliciousness, and a little bit of magical, it wasn't quite wonderful. And, combined, it didn't quite pack the punch I expected.\\n\\nInitially, this story doesn't do much to draw the reader in. I found the voice of (what I presumed to be, and was later wrong) the MC to be a little off and not very engaging. And the same could be said for the other POVs, which was something of a disappointment. As is typical for me, though, the one perspective I liked the most was the one we had the least.\\n\\nI think what works against this offering is that the found family element doesn't feel realistic. This group of motley misfits, living in this condo complex, on a small island, are drawn together by proximity and a few strange events and things quickly escalate in a way that doesn't feel quite believable; which is kind of funny because I was absolutely onboard with the magical part of the story.\\n\\nI think, had this been given a little more time to breathe, the page count been a little longer, it might have fleshed things out more. But maybe it's supposed to be a snapshot. It's something of a beginning for these characters, or a reset, or a new chapter, and there's something hopeful in that, in letting go and moving on. But as a reader (or at least, for this one) it's also a little unsatisfying.\\n\\nHaving said that, I'm very glad to see SAA pop up after such a long time (her last release was 2015!) and I do hope there's more to come.

I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'d much rather be an other bird than just the same old thing.\"\\n\\nThis was such a sweet and delightful book, uplifting. It’s a story about how to move past a sorrowful, often traumatic background. The characters come together in a residential condo called Dellawisp, after the unique birds that live there. Dellawisp is located on Mallow Island off the coast of South Carolina. There, I met Zoey Hennessy, moving into a condo left to her by her mother who died several years back. Her father has remarried to a woman with twins and the author makes clear that Zoey is not a top priority in the family. They didn’t attend her high school graduation for grief’s sake. On move in day, Zoey meets Lisbeth, a cantankerous woman whose loud remonstrations and complaints keep the other residents holed up in their homes.\\n\\nIf you don’t like magical realism, give this one a pass. Sarah Addison Allen’s ghosts captivated me. One of the residents, Mac, is a celebrated chef at a nearby hotel. Every morning he wakes up with cornmeal dusted over him and his bedcovers. Mac lost the most important person in his life heretofore and she specialized in cornmeal recipes. I found that the magical realism added a special touch.\\n\\nI had a friend who lost her brother to AIDS. She used to talk about how he left her messages all the time and how he was always leaving dimes for her to find. When my mother had a stroke, I returned from the hospital to the hotel where we were staying to find three dimes. One was on top of the freshly made bed, another on a bedside table, and another on the floor, all of them observable the minute I walked into the room. I took the dimes as a message from my Dad that Mom would be okay. She was. I’m not a person who seeks the supernatural or has an explicit belief in the hereafter, but I don’t shun it either.

Lighthearted by nature, she builds a puzzle through back stories that are revealed in the final chapters, the mark of a carefully planned out plot.\\n\\nThe story takes place in Mallow Island, a tourist area in the Carolinas whose history is unique in many ways. Having learned she'd become owner of her deceased mother's condo unit at the Dellawisp, Zoe uses her trust fund to move there since she'd enrolled in a college nearby. Originally a historical mansion and named after the tiny indigenous birds, Roscoe Avenger, a local author took possession, and sold the units after a remodel. Among the residents were Paloma Hennessy, Zoe's mother, estranged sisters Lizbeth and Lucy, Mac a local chef, Charlotte, a henna artist and Frasier, the resident manager.\\n\\nZoe is eighteen and has a pet bird called Pigeon whom only she is able to see and hear. Not long before she arrives, we learn Lizbeth has passed away leaving her condo in total shambles. Zoe is the upbeat innocent type who instantly bonds with Charlotte who's secrets are kept close to the chest. A Cuban immigrant, Paloma had married a wealthy yet abusive executive, divorced him when Zoe was young and moved to Mallow Island and passed away due to illness. Since Frasier had known Paloma, he tells Zoe Roscoe Avenger seeks stories Lizbeth had written and wishes to publish them and Zoe is offered the job of finding them. Given the disaster the unit was left in, as her belongings are slowly inspected, we learn of her son Oliver who attends college in CA. Being the only child, it becomes Frasier's task to make him aware of he's inherited the condo. Its here where important elements about the estranged sisters are revealed along with the dysfunctional relationship Lizbeth had with Oliver.\\n\\nInteractions between the residents of the Dellawisp are complex as are the 'ghost' stories that form the 'glue'. Between Zoe learning of her mother and the island's history, Mac's fascination with cornmeal, the mystery of the tiny birds and countless other plot points, the author does a masterful job of bringing them together toward the end.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of spoilers nor am I the type that likes to go into plot details.

       " 'The opening chapter of Xochitl Gonzalez’s debut novel, “Olga Dies Dreaming,” is all about napkins — wildly overpriced wedding reception napkins.\\n\\nThat may sound like a small cloth in which to wrap a big book, but Gonzalez folds those napkins into a satire of consumer excess, an appraisal of business morality and a study of family relations.\\n\\nIn short: Don’t underestimate this new novelist. She’s jump-starting the year with a smart romantic comedy that lures us in with laughter and keeps us hooked with a fantastically engaging story. A Hulu pilot is already in the works starring Aubrey Plaza, and given this source material, it should be terrific.\\n\\nGonzalez’s heroine is Olga Isabel Acevedo, a 40-year-old dynamo from South Brooklyn. At a young age, Olga set her sights on success and never wavered — not when her mother abandoned her and not when her father died of AIDS. “Every single thing she had done with her life she had figured out for herself,” Gonzalez writes. Now as the owner of a business she built from scratch, Olga charges well-heeled women in New York, Dallas and Palm Beach a fortune to plan their weddings. If that involves fencing liquor from Russian mobsters and overcharging brides for phantom place settings, who’s counting? After all, as a regular guest on “Good Morning, Later,” Olga is the closest thing America has to a wedding-planner celebrity. . . .',\n",

It's anti-revolutionary, and frames organizers in the same light as the people responsible for the gentrification of Brooklyn. Such a shallow analysis of gentrification, race, and class. The letters from the mother felt removed and unnecessary. Also, just simply not researched. It's so apparent the author is writing the mother as a villian, and I'm sure it was based on real life as her own mother was a socialist activist and the author's instagram makes it apparent she isnt. But the mother in the book is supposed to be in The Young Lords, yet describes another character who joins the Vietnam war as brave? Which would have been completely against the views of The young Young Lords at the time. I also found one of the storylines relating to a character's sexuality to be contrived and not resolved, along with the ethical issues that characters dealt with. I also didn't like some of the comments the main character made towards her partner, but he was also a clown. I know I already said this, but I truly cannot believe the absurd way this book talks about gentrification its actually hilarious!! Lastly, the writing gave YA vibes in a way that One Last Stop gave me, and I just didn't have a good time.\\n\\nOverall what was this book supposed to teach us? The good points made about Puerto Rico were glossed over with this love conquers all narrative.

An absorbing snapshot of the personal and the political, the micro and the macro, the complexities of our current world.\\n\\nSet mostly in 2017 just as Puerto Rico is in the midst of a disastrous hurricane season, it centers on siblings Olga and Prieto Acevedo. The children of Puerto Rican radicals, born and raised in pre-gentrified Brooklyn, they have worked their way up to positions of prestige, he as a congressman and she as a wedding planner for the ultra-rich. Now in their 40s, neither has fully come to grips with their personal lives or their roles in the world. Their tumultuous childhood still weighs heavy on them both and yet they both move through the world pretending it never happened.\\n\\nThe primary factor in this weight is their absent mother, who left when they were children because she wanted the life of a true radical, not weighed down by family. But both before she left and in letters for years afterwards, she has sought to teach her children her values of revolution. As children do, both Olga and Prieto have rebelled from their mother's teachings in a variety of ways, but their touchiness around their mother's politics and affection has left them both living half-lives.\\n\\nThe story here is how they both move to be more honest versions of themselves, both as individuals and as people living in a capitalist nation that doesn't care about the needs of people of color. It is common nowadays to note that the personal is political, but it doesn't always come across well in fiction. It can feel void of emotion or it can feel so focused on the personal or a metaphor that it doesn't ever feel like the real world. But the world González builds for us feels exactly like the real ones, the concerns of Prieto and Olga are concerns regular people have. In particular, their sense of helplessness when Hurricane Maria strikes, that feeling of trying to figure out how you can help in the face of a massive crisis, rings true.\\n\\nThis all makes the book sound very serious but what's so great about it is how it manages to be light and funny even in the midst of all the serious topics it takes on. It is compulsively readable. I never wanted to stop. Even when you want to shake Olga and Prieto for their shortsightedness (which is often) you care about them deeply and you can see exactly how they got to where they are.\\n\\nThis is a New York novel, and a very good one. So many New York novels are about rich white people, Olga's clients. Or they're about aimless white young people who never seem to be in any real financial danger, who meander through life without taking much note of the world they walk through. This is not that. This feels like the actual New York, even if Olga and Prieto are technically well off and have enjoyed their share of privileges, they grapple with how this can separate them from their family and their community.\\n\\nThis would pair well with MAKE YOUR HOME AMONG STRANGERS, which also features a Latinx woman suddenly thrown into a world of well-off white people, and also balances the personal and political to excellent effect.\\n\\nI did this on audio, and thoroughly enjoyed that medium.\\n\\nContent warnings for sexual assault, suicide, heroin addiction, and truly terrible rich people.\",\n",

She has worked hard completely on her own to become successful. I really admired her ability to push forward and she is unconcerned about how others view her. Her brother, Pedro has become a Congressman in the Southern Brooklyn district they grew up in. I really liked the relationship between Sister and Brother. Both could lean on each other.\\n\\nYet, something is missing in Olga’s life. I liked that she is searching for her own identity, yet feels such a strong connection to her community, and the family she has now. She grew up in Southern Brooklyn and the area is gentrifying which understandably makes her feel like she is becoming invisible. Where can she go to find her roots and identity if not her sacred love for the Brooklyn she loves? She is great at helping others with their love life, but has a really hard time connecting to someone. She meets Matteo, and I really loved this part. He centers Olga and gives her a sense of real love that she has been missing. It is so hard for her to make a commitment, but she really wants to change.\\n\\nI had a really hard time with Olga’s mom, Blanca. She has left Olga at 13 years old to become a revolutionary to Free Puerto Rico. So, this book is starts off sort of light and funny and suddenly it feels very heavy handed. Blanca only communicates with her children through letters that are manipulative and often very cruel. She only accepts her children’s choices if they are doing what she wishes for ‘the movement’ and that to her means a violent overthrow of the government. So, this becomes a jarring education on the fate of Puerto Rico through her eyes. Yes, when Hurricane Maria happened it was devastating for Puerto Rico and definitely much more should have been done. Still, this part was just hard to read. How could a mother meet her son and not care anything about him and his life. The same with Olga, she does not care at all about her, only asks if she can influence an awful person so she can help the revolution. This really was a bit too much. The book changed so much when I was reading this. Save this for another book.\\n\\nSo, I liked Olga and really wished the best for her. I liked that she has loves family, Matteo, and her community. She is free to choice to run her own life and actually feel some hope and joy. That was the best message the book gave. Plus, it really is a love story to Brooklyn and that was touching.

I loved the conversation about how to deal with colonization in the modern world. For anyone who is from a country whose native lands were repurposed into vacation spots for white people, you're familiar with this ongoing discussion. I felt the author did a great job of representing the major positions. We have the people whose goal it is to assimilate, because when you've been fed that European culture is superior for so long you eventually believe it. We have the people who want to work from within the system of the Oppressor to get them to back down, but are generally only ever able to make incremental improvement. And then you have those like Olga's mom, who are willing to do anything to win the one sided war against an entity who barely acknowledge them.\\n\\n2.

When he speaks Spanish to Olga it is from a place of love, love for her sure, but also love for his childhood and a community that helped raise him.\\n\\n3. Olga and her brothers relationship with their mom was so well written. Emotional abuse from a distance. It was frustrating at times as an outsider, but it makes complete sense when you think of the death of their dad, cultural/familial expectations and Catholic guilt.\\n\\nThis book is not for everyone.

Kingsolver earned degrees in Biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her most famous works include The Poisonwood Bible, the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and , a non-fiction account of her family\\'s attempts to eat locally.\\n\\nHer work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments. Each of her books published since 1993 have been on Best Seller list. Kingsolver has received numerous awards, including the UK\\'s Orange Prize for Fiction 2010, for and the National Humanities Medal. She has been nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.\\n\\nIn 2000, Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize to support \"literature of social change.\"\\n\\nKingsolver was born in Annapolis, Maryland in 1955 and grew up in Carlisle in rural Kentucky. When Kingsolver was seven years old, her father, a physician, took the family to the former Republic of Congo in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her parents worked in a public health capacity, and the family lived without electricity or running water.\\n\\nAfter graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. Eventually, however, she changed her major to biology when she realized that \"classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them:] get to play \\'Blue Moon\\' in a hotel lobby.\" She was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the Vietnam war. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1977, and moved to France for a year before settling in Tucson, Arizona, where she would live for much of the next two decades. In 1980 she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona, where she earned a Master\\'s degree in ecology and evolutionary biology.\\n\\nKingsolver began her full-time writing career in the mid 1980s as a science writer for the university, which eventually lead to some freelance feature writing. She began her career in fiction writing after winning a short story contest in a local Phoenix newspaper. In 1985 she married Joseph Hoffmann; their daughter Camille was born in 1987.

       " 'It’s barely Halloween. The ball won’t drop in Times Square for another two full months, and more good books will surely appear before the year ends. But I already know: My favorite novel of 2022 is Barbara Kingsolver’s “Demon Copperhead.”\\n\\nEqual parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love. Damon is the only child of a teenage alcoholic — “an expert at rehab” — in southwest Virginia. He becomes aware of his status early, around the same time he gets the nickname Demon. “I was a lowlife,” he says, “born in the mobile home, so that’s like the Eagle Scout of trailer trash.” The more he grasps the connotations of words like “hick” and “redneck,” the more discouraged he becomes. “This is what I would say if I could, to all the smart people of the world with their dumb hillbilly jokes. …We can actually hear you.”\\n\\nNow, we can hear him.\\n\\n“You get to a point of not giving a damn over people thinking you’re worthless,” he says. “Mainly by getting there first yourself.”\\n\\nDemon is right about America’s condescending derision, but he’s wrong about his own worth. In a feat of literary alchemy, Kingsolver uses the fire of that boy’s spirit to illuminate — and singe — the darkest recesses of our country.\\n\\nThe essential Americanness of “Demon Copperhead” feels particularly ironic given that Kingsolver has drawn her inspiration directly from one of England’s most celebrated classics: “David Copperfield,” by Charles Dickens. In a brief afterword, Kingsolver expresses her gratitude to Dickens and acknowledges....',\n",
       " '⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\\n\\nDemon Copperhead entered the world in a single trailer, born to a single mother who hadn’t a clue how to look after him - nor did she have the means. The southern Appalachian mountains of Virginia is where he took his first breath - a place of dire poverty, though most local folk were in the same boat, so it was pretty normal. Demon’s mum though had additional problems, and that meant even less of the basic needs for the two of them. Thank God for good neighbours.\\n\\nI won’t go into the synopsis as this is a lengthy (over 600 pages) and eventful novel. However, this is a tale of love and the need for love, it’s about dreams and anger, hate and pain, and what really stands out is how the opioid crisis is responsible for many of those bad feelings, and demonstrates how it wrecks the lives that might otherwise have climbed out of that daily grinding poverty, perhaps realising those long held dreams and ambitions.\\n\\nThe journey for Demon Copperhead is long and eventful, (epic is the best way to describe it). The writing is so beautiful - exquisite even, but it takes the reader to places so dark, depressing and dangerous with its intimate detail, that you wonder why you find such beauty in it. But it’s there on every page, in every event and every crisis - harrowing yet uplifting. Has to be one of the standout books of the year - it is stunning!\\n\\n*Thank you to Netgalley and Faber and Faber Ltd for my much appreciated ARC. I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange *',\n",
       " 'This novel is described as a modern day version of David Copperfield, which I’ve never read. I’m generally not a fan of rewrites of classics, so if I had read it, I may not have picked this one up even though Barbara Kingsolver is such an amazing writer whose books I have loved over the years. I’m grateful to have read this novel because I would have missed out on a brilliant story - brutal, but brilliant and a character who was in my heart from the first to the last page .\\n\\nAn addicted teenage mother, an abusive stepfather, a corrupt foster care system reeking of abuse is what Demon Copperhead endures at the young age of ten years old. Working on a tobacco farm, then with a family who has him sleeping in a dog room, hungry, taking leftovers from school lunch trays, he endures - somehow without speaking up to his case worker for fear of what his next foster situation would be. His next one turns out to be life altering in more ways than one. This is an in your face, in your gut punch, no holds barred portrayal all of that, and a stabbing expose of the opioid epidemic in Appalachia.\\n\\nIt’s depressing and heartbreaking to read with little respite. I was drained at times . As with other books by Kingsolver, there is a social message here, but it’s not just told with statistics of addictions, deaths, but through the moving story of a character as a little boy and then as a young man, with all of the horrors he faced in between, feeling as real as it gets .\\n\\n\\nI received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss.',\n",
       " \"Everyone and their dog has been falling all over the place expressing their love for Barbara Kingsolver’s latest release. And then there’s me . . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m not here to yuck your yum so Imma keep it real short. In a nutshell, Kingsolver is an author who is consistently trying to write the “Great American Novel” and nothing demonstrates that more than her undertaking a modernization of . In short, I just don’t think she’s my jam. Nearly 25 years ago knocked my socks off, but it’s a book I could never re-read in fear that I wouldn’t have the same reaction a second time around.\\n\\nMy main issue with this one is that I am so over clichéd, stereotypes of Appalachia. Boy oh boy did deliver them in spades. Our impoverished lead goes from bad to worse when it comes to an abusive household, to being orphaned, to one awful foster home situation to another (but don't worry - it ends at neglect - Kingsolver isn't ready to go to the darkest of locales when it comes to Demon's childhood). Eventually genetics get on young Demon’s side and he becomes a local high school football hero . . . until, you guessed it, his knee gets blown out and he becomes an addict. But don’t worry – he still gets a fairly happy ending and sees the ocean *eyeroll*\\n\\nIn addition to the been there/done that feel of this entire story, you can’t re-write history in an attempt to prove how “woke” you are. A high school English teacher (and a black teacher in the middle of the Holler, at that) in the early to mid-1990s wouldn't have dared to explain the movement of literature changing the term “black” to “Black.” Not to mention how regular folks were not aware of the dangers of opioids or how Big Pharma was controlling the narrative when they first hit the market, but the nurse in here was 100% in the know of what's going down.

       " 'Now Winner of the Women\\'s Prize for Fiction 2023 *aaargh*\\nJoint Winner of the Pulitzer Prize 2023 with the equally simplistic Trust\\nA twist on David Copperfield, focusing on an Appalachian boy whose life is overshadowed by the opioid epidemic? That sounds like a fantastic idea. And Kingsolver does a great job crafting Demon Copperhead\\'s voice, making the resourceful boy (and later young man) sound witty, empathetic, and engaging, infusing his whole vibe with some and . Of course we\\'re also dealing with an important topic, and Kingsolver is here to give the overlooked and left-behind a voice - but this is where the problem starts.\\n\\nI am not at all saying that a successful, famous writer is generally unable to convey what it means to be a person like destitute Demon in the rural South, it just doesn\\'t work very well in this particular text, and the reason can be found in the plot itself: While Kingsolver has a lot of empathy for her characters and is obviously very upset about the societal situation - this book is rooted in her impetus for change -, everything that happens to Demon is already present in the readers\\' preconceived notions of socially unstable, \"backwards\" Appalachia: Teenage single mom with substance abuse issues who dies? Check. Mean step-dad? Check. Abuse in the foster system? Check. Demon gets addicted to opioids? Check.\\n\\nSure, the language is often evocative due to the strong narrator Demon, but at the end of the day, Kingsolver activates stereotypes that already exist in the readers\\' repertoire, and then adds some social commentary (capitalism is bad; rural communities deserve respect; the Sackler family is trash, etc.), so we all can feel like we are standing on the correct side, that we who are reading this are the good ones. This unchallenging outrage activism, no matter how well-intentioned, has a tendency to be patronizing and to serve as a narcissistic tool of moral self-assurance. It\\'s, to put it bluntly, intellectually lazy, and it certainly does not help to show people from Appalachia in a new, more nuanced light - on the contrary: It only tells us what we already believe to be true.\\n\\nI, for once, want literature to challenge my beliefs, especially regarding communities I am not familiar with, so groups of people that only exist as reflections in my head to begin with (I am German, but I think Appalachia is a region that is unfamiliar to many Americans as well). When a novel relies so heavily on widespread notions and then adds clichéd narrative devices (of course Demon, in the most classic of all classic motifs, is also an artist; and there is the tragic twist; and a football coach; and the good-hearted grandmother, ... *argh*), it becomes rather annoying, especially because this novel is way, way, way too long. Boy, it is long. It\\'s insane. It just goes on. And on. And then it goes on. And finally, the ending is pure kitsch.\\n\\nSo I guess this has solid chances to get Booker-nominated as the Oprah book club crowd-pleaser with the socially relevant message that outstays its welcome and is of dubious literary merit. If so, I\\'m glad that I can already cross it off my list. Demon as a character is great though.',\n",
       " \"I love Barbara Kingsolver, so I picked this as our book club selection. Then, I had the bright idea that since this was based on David Copperfield, I should try reading that first. 800 pages, dry as dirt, and I gave up at page 200. That had me worried. Until the first page of this book. OMG! The language! Her way with words is beyond description. I wanted to highlight multiple phrases per page. I quickly realized I’d be highlighting the whole book. I found myself getting caught up time after time by some phrase or sentence. She just tells it so you really understand something.\\nThis book sucked me in. Demon’s life was one long sorrowful moan. But not just his. Almost everyone in this tale has had trouble. This is a deeply depressing book. But thank heavens it ends on a note of hope for those still standing at the end.\\nI was impressed that Kingsolver was able to take this re-telling of David Copperfield and make it about the opioid crisis in Appalachia. It shows that not much has changed between Victorian times and now when it comes to the disadvantaged being marginalized and ignored. It starts with an area with little on offer, government programs stretched beyond its limits and first one, then another, industry more interested in profits than people. The plot is a reminder that severe poverty isn’t just limited to the inner cities. If anything, there's as much prejudice against the “trailer trash”. “A blight on the nation…a smudge on the map.”\\nI highly recommend this and it is definitely one of my favorite books of the year. I can’t wait to discuss this at book club.\",\n",
       " 'I waited a long time to get my turn for this book from the library. I was anticipating it with relish, because several of my trusted friends had loved it and said they, like me, had not enjoyed Kingsolver’s last few books. I was all prepared to be swept away, and I was in the beginning, but Demon has a voice that captivates you and then wears on you and then wears you out.\\n\\nAt least Kingsolver wasn’t preaching to me in this book, but she did seem to be in love with the sound of her own voice, because she wrote pages and pages on subjects that could have sufficed with much less, and she repeated herself endlessly regarding both the lousy DSS system, the details of drug addiction, and the hopelessness of anyone who is born in the hills of Appalachia. At some point, for me, that hopelessness became a bit like the prejudice she seemed to be railing against.\\n\\nThe first 200 pages of this book were somewhat enchanting, the middle was a slog, and the ending was not enough to make up for that. It was not a bad read, but not the 5-star read I had hoped for. Perhaps in the end, you cannot tell someone else’s story as well as they do. David Copperfield is 10-star material, Kingsolver transformed it into something just a tad over okay.\\n\\nI had said to myself once before that Kingsolver and I were done with one another, but this book tempted me back for another try. This time, I think, the breakup is permanent. So many other authors I want to give a fair chance.\\n\\nIf you have the stomach for the endless beating of the opioid drum, this book will be for you. There are meant to be redeeming moments at the end, promises of better lives for a few, but those seem more like dreams, while the sinking and despair that consumed ninety percent of this book seemed all too real.',\n",

       " \"Demon Copperhead is said to be inspired by David Copperfield, a masterpiece I read a couple of years ago. I most definitely can see that inspiration in Kingsolver’s novel. I would be hesitant, however, to make any further comparisons because for me that puts a contemporary novel on shaky ground when setting it next to a classic, beloved book. I can somehow forgive Charles Dickens for his verbosity. After all, that was the vogue back in his day. David Copperfield was a series of installments, stretched out over a period of time. He didn’t get paid by the word but by installment; still, he had a lot of mouths to feed. Barbara Kingsolver, on the other hand, could have done with a lot less, and I would have been a much happier reader for it. That’s not to say that her points are less important than Dickens’ themes. She absolutely had good reason to share what she did here.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this isn’t only about drugs and pharmaceutical companies and shady doctors taking advantage of a whole group of people. It’s also about the foster care system and how it fails those most in need of protection. It’s about the long reach of the coal mine owners and how their power reverberated across the years, affecting everything in these individual’s lives from wages to education to property and more. Someone should be held accountable, and that’s where I find Kingsolver’s work to be admirable, without a doubt. However, I still couldn’t get the author out of my head while reading this story - despite the fact it was supposedly told through a young boy-turned-young adult’s point of view. I’ve read and loved some of Kingsolver’s earlier work but have had difficulty with more of her “recent” work for the same reason. If I sense the writer sitting next to me on the couch while I read, I get a little cranky. I would much rather feel like his or her characters are having a nice heart to heart with me instead. And that brings me to another niggle - Demon’s “voice” throughout the book. I just couldn’t jibe with it. It got on my nerves A LOT!\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t mind gritty but what I couldn’t quite wrap my head around was who on earth is speaking these words? Supposedly, this is Demon as a young boy at the start of the story (the above passage occurs on page 2). Is this a super savvy kid speaking? Or is it Demon as an old man looking back and narrating? Or is it Kingsolver trying really hard to create a voice she feels is authentic? I don’t know, honestly. But it happened over and over again to me throughout the 500+ pages. It's like nails on a chalkboard!\\n\\nOkay, I’ll lay off the complaining now. This is, after all, a 3-star book in my mind so there has to be another good thing or two, right?! What I loved most were the strong women in Demon’s life. Without them, I’m afraid to imagine Demon’s fate. In these Appalachia stories, I’ve often found that the women are the ones holding down the fort. It’s their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity that forms a safety net for those they care for most. And I can see where these women equate to those in Dickens’ story as well. This makes for a bit of fun, but you surely don’t need to read his book to understand this one. It just adds another level perhaps. There’s even a passage in here where Demon nods to that famous work.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll say that this is an important topic to explore. Personally, it would work better if it had been edited more thoroughly. Yes, a shorter story can still make a huge impact. I also think a non-fiction piece on the opioid crisis would be a lot more effective for me. I know they are out there, and I will explore that option more thoroughly. Now, would I have loved this more if Richard Armitage had been reading it to me as he did ? Damn straight I would have!! He could have read another 500 pages of this one to me and I’d have been content.\",\n",
       " \"3.75⭐\\n\\n*Joint Winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction with Hernan Diaz's Trust *\\n*Winner of the 2023 Women’s Prize for Fiction*\\n\\n“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.”\\n\\nA retelling of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, in a contemporary Southern Appalachian setting, by is a powerful work of fiction. Part coming of age, part social commentary, the narrative revolves around the eponymous Demon Copperhead, born Damon Fields, (named after his father Damon, who died from an accident before his birth, earning the nickname “Copperhead” on account of his copper wire hair) to an addict mother in a trailer park in Lee County, Virginia. We follow Demon from his childhood through his early adulthood, as he grapples with poverty, loss, abuse, loneliness, and short-lived moments of hope and success as a young athlete with college dreams before an injury derails his plans and his struggle with addiction and substance abuse. Narrated in the first person by Demon, as he shares his perspective on the people and events that shape his life and his worldview, this is a story of grief, resilience and ultimately the search for a sense of belongingness and the will to survive when the odds are stacked against you.\\n\\n\\n\\nRather than compare this novel to the classic that inspired this story, I prefer to discuss what I felt about this book based on its individual merit.\\n\\nThere is a lot to unpack here. The author writes with compassion in simple yet elegant prose. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints the picture of the lives of those caught up in a vicious cycle of poverty, neglect and addiction, the Opioid Crisis in particular but also takes a grim look at issues such as parental negligence, child abuse and the foster care system among others. The characterizations are superb and the author skillfully weaves a large cast of distinctive characters into the narrative without it becoming overwhelming or too difficult to follow. The author also addresses how outsiders harbor certain preconceived notions about certain communities without totally understanding the challenges they face.\\n\\nI was engrossed in Demon's journey for the first half of this novel, after which the repetitiveness caused the pace to falter but it does pick up in the last quarter of the story. There are segments in the narrative that I felt were unnecessarily detailed and could have been shorter without affecting the overall impact of the novel.\\n\\nThough the story is dark and depressing for the most part, it is peppered with moments of humor and hope amid the bleakness that pervades Demon’s life and ends on a hopeful note.\\n\\nThis was my first Barbara Kingsolver novel and I look forward to exploring more of her work.\",\n",
       " '5+\\nI am far from the first one to be blown away by this phenomenal book. How can one novel be heart-breaking, beautiful, amazing, poignant, and funny? Barbara Kingsolver lives in these mountains she writes about, this area of southern Appalachia that is a place of immense beauty but which is known more for its poverty, unemployment, and addiction. The Appalachian people, people who are often ridiculed for their rural ways and particular speech.“All down the years, words have been flung like pieces of shit, only to get stuck on a truck bumper with up-yours pride. Rednecks, moonshiners, ridgerunners, hicks, deplorables.”Kingsolver writes from the heart with love and understanding. She has written many fine books but, in my opinion, this is her best since The Poisonwood Bible.\\n\\nRather than retell the story (No! No! Please don’t!), I will share some of my favorite quotes. Please realize these are just a sampling of the many I might have included.\\n\\n“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end up with nothing, and lose so much.”\\n\\n“I wanted to go home, which was nowhere, but it’s a feeling you keep having, even after that’s no place anymore.”\\n\\n“I’d live long enough to know shit doesn’t bounce off.”\\n\\n“Certain pitiful souls around here see whiteness as their last asset that hasn’t been totaled or repossessed.”\\n\\n“A junkie catches his flight. That sugar on your brain cells sucks away any other purpose. The human person you were gets yanked out through whatever hole the devil can find.”\\n\\n“I thought about what Rose said, wanting to see the rest of us hurt, because she was hurting. You have to wonder how much of this whole world’s turning is fueled by that very fire.”\\n\\n“That’s the deal of sober life: celebrate the fresh start, suck up your sadness for all that was left behind”.\\n\\nI hope those who haven’t read this masterpiece will love it too.',\n",
       " 'Demon Copperhead deserves every fiction prize there is. Every single one of them. Even the ones that don\\'t exist.\\n\\nMany years ago, shortly after I started working at my library, I mentioned to a colleague I had a headache.\\n\\n\"Mabel\", sweet and helpful as ever, said to come back to her desk and she\\'d give me something for it. She pulled out a gallon-size Ziploc bag (that\\'s almost 4 liters, for all the non-United Statians reading this).\\n\\nMabel asked me what kind did I want. \\'Um, ibuprofen?\\' I queried, not seeing anything but orange prescription bottles in that see-through plastic bag.\\n\\nShe looked at me and said she didn\\'t have it but any of these pills would help a lot more than ibuprofen would. \\n\\nI declined, worried to take prescription painkillers. I worried for , seeing that big ol\\' bag.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t take all of these, , Mabel?\", I asked. \\n\\nShe said well of course she did, \"Jenna, when you get old, you get a lot of different pains and each of these are for a different one\". \\n\\nWith that, Mabel began pulling out bottles, reading the labels as she did. \"This here\\'s for my neck. This for my back. Oh, this is the best, it helps my arthritis,\" she said, shaking a bottle of Oxys. \\n\\nShe continued pulling out bottles, lining them up on the edge of her desk. I think\\n\\nA white-haired, intelligent, professionally employed woman, Mabel wasn\\'t your stereotypical addict. She had been a librarian for decades, the favorite of most of our patrons. But, She wasn\\'t some lowlife just looking to get high. She trusted her doctors and believed them that you couldn\\'t get addicted if you really had pain.\\n\\nThere are so many stories about addiction, some true, some based on the truth. Mabel, while not her real name, was a real person with a real addiction that probably killer her (she had a brain aneurysm which are often brought on by opioids). Not all stories have happy endings.\\n\\nAs for this book and this story, I loved it. Loved it in so many ways and for so many reasons. Barbara Kingsolver, being Appalachian, \"gets\" Appalachians, us hillbillies. She writes with so much authenticity.\\n\\nThese characters? I know them. They live down the street, they come in the library, they shop at Walmart, pushing their \"buggies\" full of sugar drinks and sugar cereals, trying to get the most amount of calories for their kids for the least amount of dollars.\\n\\nMs. Kingsolver also \"gets\" the pain pill/heroin epidemic, how and why it started, and how greedy pharmaceutical CEOs and everyone under them, down to both the equally greedy doctors and the well-meaning but witless ones, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives.\\n\\nThere is a lot about addiction in these pages, but there\\'s so much more than that. It is real and deep and emotional and . It is what could have been if JD Vance wasn\\'t such a stuck on himself braggart asshole. \\n\\nI knew this kid, I\\'d seen him grow up, and watched him grow up all over again through the pages of this book. I cannot praise it highly enough, trite as those words are. It\\'s difficult to find words to describe it - again trite, but the truth. \\n\\nIf you want a book that is going to suck you in and hold you rapt and take you on a roller coaster of emotions, is the book for you. Don\\'t be intimidated by the length. As another friend wrote in her review (hey, Diane 👋🏼), \"it needs every word to get this story told.\"',\n",
       " 'The excellent cover design first drew me to this book. I thought a modern adaptation of the classic David Copperfield would be a formidable task. When I saw it was written by Barbara Kingsolver, who wrote three of my favourite books, all wildly different in theme and location, The Poisonwood Bible, The Lacuna, and Flight Behaviour, I knew I wanted to purchase and read this. This is unlike her other books that enthralled me. It is an epic tale (over 600 pages) and a fabulous read. Its characters, the good, the wicked, the uncaring, and the disinterested, will stay in my memory for a long time.\\n\\nDemon (Damon) Copperhead was born to a teenage, addicted mother on the floor of her trailer. They faced extreme poverty in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. The story follows Demon from his birth to young manhood. The writing is exquisite, although describing dark and disturbing circumstances. Demon narrates his life story, often with a sardonic sense of humour about deplorable situations. His father died before his birth, and Demon inherited his father\\'s good looks and flaming red hair (Copperhead). His mother remarried a vile, abusive, violent man. Kindly neighbours, the Piggotts, were an early refuge for him, and the family also cared for other orphaned or forgotten children from dead or absent relatives.\\n\\nAt age ten, Demon finds himself in the foster system when his mother dies. The system\\'s workers were overburdened and usually uncaring, overlooking terrible situations where they placed their charges. He finds himself working on a farm with several orphaned boys, treated as slave labour, poisoned by the sap from tobacco plants, and nearly starved. Then he is moved to the McCobbs, sleeping in a dog\\'s room, and expected to earn money by working outside the home to supplement the family\\'s income. He rarely can attend school, and when he does, it reinforces his low self-esteem. Always hungry and poorly dressed, he is shunned by his classmates. He works in the trash after school and seldom is clean.\\n\\nThings start to look better when he moves into the home of a football coach who is determined to make a football player out of Demon for his winning team. He feels unworthy even in his short glory days as a football player. A painful injury on the sports field ends his brief football career and starts him on pain medication and the road to addiction. He becomes friends with Angus, the coach\\'s teenager.\\n\\nDemon becomes reacquainted with an old friend from the miserable farm where they both laboured. This friend works for a local newspaper laying out ads and cartoon strips. Demon helps him by creating a superhero from the Appalachian region, as all the superheroes are drawn with their exploits in cities. The cartoon strip became very popular and is syndicated to other regional papers. One kindly art teacher recognizes Demon\\'s talent for drawing cartoons and supports his efforts.\\n\\nHowever, things are going badly for Demon outside the newspaper office. He has married a girl he thinks is adorable. She is clingy and needy, will not cook or clean the house, and appliances have long stopped functioning. They live in filthy, nasty conditions, and she has fallen deep into drug addiction. She becomes distraught and angry if he leaves home to run errands or go to work. His memories of earlier injustices and poverty flood his mind and emotions with despair.\\n\\nHis old friends are now part of the opioid and meth crisis, and Demon joins them. His best friend from the Piggott home is far into drugs and weird Gothic dress, and he and the once popular QB football hero are dealing. Former friends start dying from overdoses and reckless behaviour. Are there any supportive people who will save some of the addicted youth? Will Demon find a way out of his tragic past?\\n\\nWe learn something about the region\\'s history, the coal mining, those impoverished, marginalized people scorned by others and designated hillbillies and rednecks. ( a word with an interesting origin),\\nand with social situations little improved since the time of Charles Dickens.\\nDemon comments on David Copperfield, one of the few books he managed to read in school, \" The Charles Dickens one seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over, and nobody gives a rat\\'s ass. You\\'d think he was from around here.\"\\n\\nHighly recommended!',\n",
       " 'I know some readers want a novel to be concise, revised down to your basic 300-ish pages, but what a luxurious feeling it is when you find yourself more than 300 pages into a book that is really engaging, with characters you truly care about, and realize there are more than 500 pages left to go. You get to know the people in these books better, maybe see them grow over a longer period of time. You get to know the whole world of the book better. But that makes it even sadder when you finish it.\\n\\nI loved this book, a modern Appalachian retelling of David Copperfield, another very long book that I really liked. Kingsolver is good at both seriousness and playfulness, as Dickens was, and she cares deeply about backwoods, rocky Virginia. This works for me, too- I never lived in Appalachia, but I have deep family roots in West Virginia, and I care about that part of the world. I got invested in young Demon (a nickname for Damon) quickly and cared about him all the way through. Even when he makes awful mistakes in this book, he’s a loving person, and I think his worst mistakes are made out of love. He’s good at making connections with people who might save him, too, and he’s generous with the people in his life even when things are unbelievably hard. I like how Demon, even when he’s going through something terrible, notices and is buoyed by the beauty of the natural world. The sense of place is strong in this book. The characters are even stronger, and you care about them deeply as they suffer in the eye of the opioid storm that still wracks our country. I’ve read almost all of Kingsolver’s books, and I think this has replaced The Poisonwood Bible as my favorite. As always when I’m truly loving a book, I worried about the ending. Would the author stick the landing? I am haunted by the ghosts of a few books that just lost it at the end. But she stuck the landing! I love where the book ends.\\n\\nNow I kind of feel like going back and rereading David Copperfield? It’s been a while.

As you might imagine this is not a cheerful read but it provides a scathing look at a forgotten population told by a perceptive and canny red-haired kid who has had more than his share of poverty, starvation, crummy foster homes and losses.

Truly - it was an exceptional and outstanding novel that surpassed any expectation I had. For me, the most stand out aspect was the narrative. Demon’s voice is one I’ll never forget. The author created a fascinating, impactful, endearing and heartbreaking character in Demon, giving him a voice that sent his story right to my heart. Demon’s narrative is raw and gritty. It’s filled with slang and backwoods grammar. It’s authentic and real and had me enraptured. There were many sentences of tender raw honesty from Demon that went straight to my heart.\\n\\nYou’ll be able to quickly decide if this book is for you based on how you feel about Demon’s narrative.

       " 'Barbara Kingsolver’s reworking of David Copperfield as a tale for our times is a masterful portrayal of what it can be like for a child to be born and grow up amongst the poorest and most marginalised in America today. Children who are labelled as society’s dregs and treated as if they are in some way lesser beings because their clothes are ragged and they are always hungry.\\n\\nDamon Fields, nicknamed Demon Copperhead (for his red hair), is a child born to a single teenage mother living in a trailer, his father dead before his birth, in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachians. While his mother struggles with drug addiction and is in and out of rehab, Demon is also cared for by the kindly Peggot family next door, grandparents bringing up their own grandson whose mother is in prison. He learns to love the wild forests, to hunt and fish and what it’s feels like to be part of a large family. However, when he is ten, Demon’s world really falls apart when his mother marries an abusive man with no interest in raising a child. This is the start of a downhill spiral for Demon that leads to the nightmare of foster care, where he is expected to work to earn his keep, never given enough to eat or provided with bigger clothing as he grows. After he hits his lowest point, a change in fortune will find him in a better place but, with a baggage of neglect, abuse and poverty, he’s not equipped to weather the storms still to come and is in danger of repeating the cycle of addiction and poverty.\\n\\nHowever, even at his lowest point Demon never loses his will to survive or to see the best in people. His ability to draw and conjure up superheros with the power to save the weak and downtrodden is his richest possession and along with his sense of humour and intelligence keeps him going in the toughest of times. This is a long book and I did find it slow down in the latter half when Kingsolver is fully laying out the causes and effects of the opiod crisis in America, particularly in marginalised populations, such as in poor rural areas where there is high unemployment and people are told they are worthless. However, sad and depressing Demon’s story is, it felt very real and hopefully will lead to better understanding of what it is to be caught up in poverty through no fault of your own, poorly educated and without hope and told you are worthless, with the lure of drugs one way to make it all go away for a while. Demon is a character I will not easily forget in this insightful and provocative novel. 4.5★',\n",

The promise of one of my favorite genres, coming-of-age!\\n\\nAlas, it was not to be. At least not for me.\\n\\nIt fell into that category of book that for some reason bothers me. The plot’s the thing, and we all love a good story. As for Kingsolver, she’s certainly capable of telling it. Trouble is, she told way more than I like. Not many “stop and zoom in” scenes. More \"this happened, then that happened.\" And time rolls on as the narrative years slip by.\\n\\nGuess I’d rather read a book that covers all of a day or a weekend only. That’s me. These year-jumpers tend to leave characterization in the dust. That is, the characters have no soul, and when they have no soul, I have trouble investing (making the book bankrupt as a Silicon Valley Bank, if you’ll forgive the current event metaphor).\\n\\nIn fairness, you can dismiss this review because I DNF, but I did make it to page 380 or so, and that’s more than halfway, by God, but I struggled to return to it each time I put it down. Instead, I looked at other books on my TBR shelf and they mocked me for pledging my allegiance in such a rote way. Soon I caved to the Sirens of “Life’s Too Short.”\\n\\nI don\\'t feel bad. Demon seems to be doing just fine and meeting unusual success and winning over all the girls and facing all the modern troubles (like opioids) David C. didn’t have to and I wish him well. But he really lacked depth. And the surrounding characters didn\\'t sweep me off my feet, either, meaning I was always aware of my surroundings while reading (never a good thing -- consider the movie theater when the same thing happens while viewing!).\\n\\nSo cue the music by the men in Wayfarer sunglasses (“I’m a Soul Man”) and forgive me not joining the Kingsolver parade. I’ll leave the 5-stars and hosannas to others with their marching band reviews.\\n\\nInstead, I’ll be one of the outsiders giving this a two.

She was also grieving.\\nI spent hours a day each weekend walking door-to-door selling those mints along High Street … a very unsafe thing to do for a five year old girl.\\nI won that contest, and went to overnight camp.\\n\\nToday — I hate knowing that Oakland still gets a ‘Bad Rap’ reputation— because many of us know it’s a beautiful city!!\\nHowever,\\nit was important that I visit this story — I had already known much of the horrid history - history that must not be forgotten - and crimes that should never be allowed to go unpunished.\\n\\nI was pulling for greatness for this 17-year-old author even before I started reading her book. I didn’t need to—\\nas Mottley held her own - with no help from me.\\nI’m so inspired by her. She wrote a story that needed to be told…\\nHer writing had emotional fire— one that felt like cockroaches were crawling all over my skin.\\n\\nClearly, this is not a sunny-rosey-posey novel….\\nbut it’s passionately written -powerfully affecting- spirited with purpose!\\n\\n“Downtown Oakland has a whole lot of bars clubs, and holes where people find themselves wasted and dancing at 2 am in the morning”.\\n“There’s a strip club tucked underneath a yoga studio on the corner, its metal door painted a sparkling black. I can hear the faint sounds of music and even though it’s only five or so in the evening, they’ve got the door propped open. I walk into a room dimly lit by those lightbulbs that look sort of light candles, and a few lone people are propped on the stools or sitting at the circular tables, lurking in the darkest patches of the place, the poles looming large in the center, one woman aerial and another bored”.\\n\\nKiara didn’t have a resume, and she didn’t know if she wanted a job stripping… but she was desperate. She used to think the only thing one got from turning eighteen (she was still only seventeen the day she walked into that bar)….was the right to vote.\\nHa…. apparently there were other benefits.\\n\\nFor real….\\nIn 2005, a major scandal broke out in the news involving a teenager- a sex worker at the time- in Oakland who was sexually exploited by more than a dozen police officers.\\nThe officers were suspended but no criminal charges were brought against them.\\n\\nThis story tells of the heartbreaking and devastated violence done one young girl — inspired by one case that entered the media — but there were dozens of other cases of sex workers and young women who experience violence at the hands of police and did not have their stories told.\\n\\nLeila Mottley —\\n—at age only seventeen— she knew what it felt like to be a young black girl, vulnerable, unprotected, and unseen. When she was growing up, she was often told she had to shield her brother, her dad, and all the black men around her —\\n—shield their safety, their bodies, and their dreams. But what she learned was that her own safety, body and dreams, was secondary.\\n\\nIn this novel, Kiara was a fictional character but she was a reflection of the types of violence that black and brown women faced regularly.\\nIn 2010, a study found that police sexual violence was the second most reported instance of police misconduct and disproportionately impacts women of color.\\n\\nWith Leila Mottley’s piercing prose, I am reminded that\\nsafety, justice, joy, and love is a birthright!!',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t like this book so well, because every word, phrase, sentence, paragraph pulls out all the stops.

The squeals began and the humming turned to changes and we all watched that child swim out his mama, head poking out more blood than hair, and my mama took him into her arms and laid him on Dee\\'s breast and this was the sweetest, most whole thing to ever take place in our building, and the rain poured and poured and poured until Dee began to beg again and her birthmarked baby squirmed and Ronda gave up, passed Dee the pipe, and she faded into sky like she didn\\'t hear her own baby crying.\"\\n\\nIsn\\'t that something? The rhythm, the forward motion of the language?

In Nightcrawling, Mottley has an important story to tell about poverty, racism, police violence, sex work, and other things. Mottley was a teenager when she wrote this - and unfortunately it shows. For me, it reads like undergraduate creative writing: overly descriptive, chock full of metaphors, distracting and detracting from the important themes Mottley explores. It's a shame because there's a certain rhythm to her writing that shows considerable talent. I look forward to Mottely continuing to develop as a literary writer and I hope one day Nightcrawling will be recognized as a bit of juvenilia on the road to greater things.\",\n",
       " 'Longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize!\\n\\n4.5⭐\\n\\nOur protagonist, seventeen-year-old East Oakland resident Kiara Johnson is struggling to make ends meet and keep it together for herself and her older brother Marcus who is unable to hold a job and would rather spend time (unsuccessfully) pursuing a career in music. Their father passed away when she was thirteen and her mother is currently a resident of a halfway house for reasons that are gradually revealed. Kiara also feels responsible for the well-being of nine-year-year-old Trevor her neighbor Dee’s son who is often abandoned by his mother and left to fend for himself. Kia genuinely cares for Trevor and her time spent with him is one of the few bright spots in her unhappy life. When her landlord doubles her rent and she is unsuccessful in securing gainful employment elsewhere, an unfortunate turn of events sees her take to prostitution in a last-ditch effort to avoid eviction and starvation. She tells herself that this is temporary and once Marcus gets a job or alternative avenues of income open up for her, she will stop. She still hopes for a better day when her brother would step up and take his responsibilities seriously and she would be free to choose the direction of her life.\\n\\n\\n\\nKiara’s misfortune continues when she is picked up by the police. But instead of arresting her, the local officers take advantage of her situation. She soon finds herself in the middle of a shocking scandal that garners national attention. As she prepares to testify as a key witness, her life once again is thrown into chaos. While she faces threats from those who would do everything in their power to keep their abhorrent acts from being revealed in the open, she also finds support from her friends and allies who try to help her through it all.\\n\\nThe author had drawn inspiration for her story from the real-life Oakland PD scandal of 2015. In her notes, Leila Mottley writes,\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Kiara is herself a child, forced to assume the mantle of an adult, trying to navigate her way through a world that has not been kind to her and with no respite in clear view. The depictions of social injustice, sexual abuse and exploitation are immensely disturbing and I am not surprised that many have put this one aside midway. Kiara’s journey is a painful one, but she is a survivor and we keep rooting for her. The author’s writing is powerful and almost poetic in its delivery. Compelling, timely and relevant, Leila Mottley’s Nightcrawling is a brilliant debut. I am eager to read more from this talented new author in the future.',\n",
       " 'Long Listed for the Booker 2022\\nI am stunned after listening to the audio of “Nightcrawling: A Novel” by Leila Mottley. If you enjoy a good audio, I cannot recommend this audio highly enough. Narrator Joniece Abbott-Pratt gives life to the narrator, Kiara, who tells us her story, in her own voice, as she struggles to survive on her own.\\n\\nLeila Mottley began writing this story when she was 17 years old. In 2015 when she was a young teenager in Oakland, there was a 2015 court case in which the Oakland Police Department was accused of sexually exploiting a teenager and then covering it up. Mottley, in her author’s notes, states that Kiara is pure fiction, Kiara’s life is nonfiction. Mottley wanted to give voice to the girls, women, trans, boys who have been victims of violence, especially black and brown women. She states that a 2010 study found that police sexual violence is the 2nd most reported instance of police misconduct. As our world comes to terms with police brutality regarding men of color, the violence against women are neglected in the press. Mottley shows how it begins, how the victims have little or no choices. She used the research she had done on the 2015 court case along with numerous, lesser known, cases for this story. She has done such a fine job, that she is now the youngest author nominated for the Booker Prize award.\\n\\nWhy read/listen to this story? Well, Mottley deftly shows how a young, disenfranchised girl, who wants a good, clean life, can fall prey to violence. With no or minimal adult help, these girls are attempting to negotiate supporting themselves and doing right. Furthermore, Mottley is Oakland’s youth poet laureate, and her prose are outstanding. In a scene with her lawyer, Marsha, who is trying to get her reading for a court appearance, Kiara thinks, “Marsha done looked up ‘how to be your best self’ and found some Cosmo article about actualization.”\\n\\nIn fact, one of the best reasons to read/listen to the novel is that Mottley shows us how a sassy, cheeky young girl says things that are not in alignment with their thoughts. Kiara has a good head on her shoulders and thinks, plans, and strategizes how to earn money, and take care of family. But if an adult in authority asks her a question, her retorts do not reflect her intelligence. She’s learned that is the only way to survive, to be sassy.\\n\\nI am a 65 year old white lady, and in listening to this story, I learned what it’s like to be a young black girl on the gritty streets of a major U.S. city. Mottley wisely told Kiara’s story with minimal graphic and horrific scenes. She didn’t need those scenes to get her message out. She allows the reader’s imagination to take themselves into that pit of hell.\\n\\nThis is a story of an epidemic that privileged people of our country rarely see. I highly recommend this illuminating story.',\n",
       " 'Thank you Tandem Collective Global and Penguin Random House Canada for my gifted copy.

Prostitution, abuse of all forms, death, murder, etc... Not to mention the dirty cops. Kiara never got a break. And on top of that, she became a stand-in mom to Trevor while his real mom hit the block looking for a fix.\\n\\nKeeping in mind that Leila Mottley was only 17 years old when she started writing this, I think she has potential to be a great writer. There were several introspective quotes throughout this story, but sometimes it was trying too hard to be deep. I think this can be attributed to the author\\'s age—teenagers can have moments of lucid brilliance sandwiched between notions that dating an older man is totally normal because \"I\\'m really mature.\"\\n\\nI found the ending particularly weak. After such a compelling story about the horrors Kiara faces as a young prostitute and the fallout from the OPD scandal, the author forces things to end on a high note. But instead of closing the book with hope, I found myself feeling uneasy, wondering: what TF is gonna happen to Kiara now!!? She can\\'t be on the streets anymore because she\\'s too famous for her own good. And what about lil Trevor, shuttled off to some foster care family?? Who will he grow up to be?? And Marcus??? There were so many frayed edges. I felt like Kiara was in deeper shit by the end of the whole ordeal.\\n\\nAll in all, an impressive undertaking by a young author. At 17 I was skipping a record breaking number of classes LOL. I definitely wasn\\'t selling my manuscript at an auction to publishers all over the world lol.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros: at times, thoughtful, poetic prose, enjoyed the fictionalized version of the OPD scandal\\n\\nCons: did not feel authentic at times—some major themes left unexplored after being briefly mentioned, ending was contrived, at times overwritten and awkward',\n",

I\\'ve read numerous reviews of this book, and I agree with them all except those who criticize the writing and plot.\\n\\nNightcrawling has been a struggle for me. Reading the book was a struggle. Writing this review has also been a struggle. I beg you for your tolerance, patience, and compassion.\\n\\nNightcrawling was a difficult book for me to rate. Here\\'s a summary of the rating process I used. First, the writing is top-notch. Therefore, I started with a 5. However, the subject matter is extremely unpleasant, so I subtracted 2 points for reader pain and suffering. Finally, I added 1 extra point for white man\\'s guilt and ended up with a final rating of 4.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a sociologist, economist, political scientist, teacher, or novelist, I\\'d say this is a must-read book. If you read mainly for pleasure, then you probably should avoid this book.\\n\\nNo one should have to live life the way Kiara Johnson lived after her troubles started, but the sad truth is that many people do. Regretfully, there are people who put their best foot forward but still discover doors are slammed shut in their faces. Also, some authority figures are jerks. They want others \"to feel small so they can feel big,\" and there will always be people like Kiara Johnson who \"don\\'t got no other choice\" except to choose amongst many bad alternatives.\\n\\nThis is a sociologically important book. It\\'s also politically and economically important. It makes all the bad stuff we may know about on an intellectual level feel viscerally real, and this realism burrows deep into the marrow of our bones. Nightcrawling proves that sometimes fiction has more realism (is more believable) than nonfiction.\\n\\nThis is an important book. It helps us understand the economics of our world. It helps us viscerally feel how economics impacts the lives of everyday people.\\n\\nNightcrawling is not an easy book to read. It makes us care about people and then forces us to watch them as they stumble and fall. Nightcrawling made me feel deeply blue in my heart and soul, but the book\\'s ending brought me great relief. It was upbeat but still realistic. In its own way, the book\\'s ending redefined family to include the people who help lift you up in times of trouble.',\n",

Kiara lives in a run-down Apartment building which is inappropriately named Regal-Hi Apartments, where the only thing high about it are some of the tenants. There is a pool, which is accessorized with used bags filled with dog poop floating on the surface. For Kiara, this is home, there is nowhere else to go.\\n\\nKiara’s family seems to be losing everything a little bit at a time, and a little bit at a time it diminishes her, taking the people she loves away. First, her father, who spent much of her young life in prison, died when she was just 13. Her mother was ‘sent away’ after another tragic event which followed not long after. She and her older brother Marcus are the only ones left in the apartment, neither one finished their education, and Marcus has dreams to be a star. They are broke, and rent is due. Kiara looks for jobs everywhere she can think of - but the local stores won’t hire her. She goes to the strip club hoping her brother’s ex-girlfriend who works as a bartender can give her a job, but at 17, she’s too young to work there. Her brother’s ex feels bad about not being able to help, so she offers her a drink. And then another, followed by two more. As she leaves, a man follows her out of the club, takes her to a place, and after he is done with her, he presses an unexpected roll of money into her hand and walks away.\\n\\nIt isn’t that she intended her life would turn out this way, but with her brother not able to have held onto a job and unwilling to find a new one because that would take away time from his time spent dreaming about making a career in the music industry, and a landlord threatening them with eviction, along with no money for food, Kia is glad to have the money. At least it is something. Temporarily.\\n\\nThere is a darkness in this story, softened by the beauty of the prose, but Kia is someone you will root for. Her life, at her young age with only vague memories of parental advice, has been filled with pain and an almost feral drive to survive which only increases as she is left with more responsibilities - including a nine-year-old whose mother leaves him with Kia, and then disappears. There is no one to turn to for help, and so she does what she believes she needs to, in order to endure.\\n\\nThis is a story of survival, of compassion despite the affliction of poverty and crushing injustices.

       " 'Sometimes, images get stuck in your head…\\n\\nWow, this is one dark novel, but its mesmerizing prose and captivating star of the show made it unputdownable for me. It gives you an up-close look at a (fictional) poor, black, 17-year-old girl in Oakland, California. Kiera, or Ki, as she is called, struggles to eat and pay rent, and she ends up a streetwalker—or here, called a nightcrawler (which is way more visual). The cops in this story are bad bad abusers, so be prepared to be sickened. Kiera is the one telling the story, which adds a layer of realness.\\n\\nI meant it when I said this book is dark. Look at how the book opens:\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, this sentence might send some running for cover. There aren’t other scatological images, don’t worry, but the poop in the pool is mentioned numerous times. But way worse than that picture (unfortunately, imprinted in my mind—will I ever not see it?) are the many sexual abuse scenes, which are very hard to watch and which are also stuck in my head.\\n\\nReally, I understand if people have to pass on this book, and it’s a good idea to do so if you have triggers. But for me, I appreciated getting a view of what life could be like for black people in a poverty-stricken city. It shook me up—and it made me furious at how oppressive the scene is and how corrupt police can be.\\n\\nKiera lives in a slum apartment and takes care of a 10-year-old boy because the mother has basically abandoned him. Kiera’s relationship with the boy is touching and heartbreaking. Kiera has a brother, who is a mess, but who loves Kiera so much he has a tattoo of her fingerprint on his neck. This is another image I’ll remember.\\n\\nA funny aside: I felt pretty damn cool that I knew what a grill was. If you had asked me a couple of weeks ago, I would have said, “George Foreman” as fast as could be. But the other day I watched (yep, a true confession about one of my “bad TV” addictions; hangs head in embarrassment). On the show, a panel has to guess which person out of three is telling the truth about having a certain occupation. In this case, the panel had to figure out which of the three people was the real “grill maker.” I was completely confused when the questions from the panel were about teeth instead of about cooking hamburgers in the backyard. So I Googled “grill” and discovered that a grill is also a set of gold teeth that some hip-hoppers wear. Ah ha! I’ve seen gold teeth but I didn’t know anything about them, like that there were qualified people who made grills to fit over your teeth. So fast forward, I came across” grill” in this book and patted myself on the back for knowing we weren’t talking George Foreman here:\\n\\n\\n\\nHad I not seen I would have been trying to figure out how he got his cheeks to touch his backyard grill. See? Bad TV can be very educational.\\n\\nBut seriously, this book is amazing. It’s impossible not to care deeply about Kiera and not to be wowed by the language. Every single sentence is rich and it’s easy to pay attention to them. They flow, oh so smoothly—they aren’t too abstract and I didn’t have to read them more than once. My only complaint is that the sentence structure and vocabulary are often way too sophisticated for Kiera. I did a “nevermind,” because the story was just too good for me to worry about it.\\n\\nI know the book is fiction, but it has a link to real life in that the author (who is only 19; she wrote the book when she was 17!) grew up in Oakland and she knows the scene. The story is based on a 2015 case of a cop who committed suicide.\\n\\nThis is Mottley’s debut novel. It blows my mind that she can already write with such passion and compassion, and with prose to die for. And her characters’ hearts and souls just ooze off the pages.\\n\\nThose who want a gritty story and can stomach the darkness, look no further. Prose is gorgeous, plot is ungodly dreary. The prose wins.\\n\\nI have my eye on this author. She’s so young, she has the whole world ahead of her to write more gems like this one. Can’t wait!\\n\\nThanks to Edelweiss for the advance copy.',\n",
       " 'Oof, what a powerful debut novel. Nightcrawling details the story of seventeen-year-old Kiara Johnson, a young Black teenager who turns to sex work to pay her family’s rent and care for the abandoned nine-year-old boy next door. I think Leila Mottley does an excellent job portraying the many pressures and forces of oppression in this Black girl’s life: the weight of caring for the Black men in her life, the abuse enacted upon her by the police, and how some women (e.g., women affiliated with the police, her own mother) judge her for the actions she took to survive. Despite the intergenerational and present-day trauma Kiara experiences, she still cultivates some moments of joy and connection, such as with her on and off-partner Alé and her connection with the boy next door, Trevor.\\n\\nOverall, I felt immersed in this story and so angry and saddened by the immense difficulties in Kiara’s life. Mottley’s writing is vivid and gripping and expresses Kiara’s pain and how she’s forced to put one foot in front of the other to just get to the next day. I appreciated how Mottley didn’t give us a happy ending, because it’s up to us with privilege to fight for a world where Black women aren’t forced into these horrendous circumstances. In her author’s note, Mottley says she felt inspired to write this after learning about the Oakland Police Department’s sexual exploitation of young women – I think she did a successful job of capturing this injustice and bringing it to readers’ attention with .',\n",

It\\'s honest, it\\'s angry, it takes nothing from you and gives everything to you, and it\\'s a gift so bitter that it makes you wish you hadn\\'t opened it because now you know and can\\'t pretend you don\\'t.\\n\\nIn the middle of a dreary afternoon spent doing something horribly hard, watching her mother as she dies, avoiding a gang of teens who could easily have decided she was a target, riding a bus on a hot afternoon and getting into her rent-due apartment...she wonders how she can help her older brother. Because now, next to making the rent, she\\'s got a much, much bigger problem: How to keep that brother alive. Literally not-room-temperature alive.\\n\\nThat ought to ring a bell in us all. If you\\'re an adult, you most likely found yourself nodding along and recognizing those emotions. You\\'ll likely recognize the others about regrets and about consequences and about prices you can\\'t pay to avoid. This is that kind of a story, it\\'s that kind of a world that Kiara and her wide found family live in. And those who make it out? They change addresses. They can\\'t really change when so much around doesn\\'t. This life is what you make of it, true, but is your inward being as malleable as all that?\\n\\nWhat makes me so happy is that Author Mottley is here, is the one telling the story to my white-person eyes. I\\'m so happy that someone in publishing saw this manuscript, heard this rage-filled, sorrow-drenched scream of pain and said, \"there\\'s a proud, fine writer being born here, let me put the privilege and prestige of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., behind it and make people listen.\" So, listen: If you\\'re wondering if this isn\\'t more misery porn, or worse, disaster tourism, then I\\'m going to bring it to you fresh, this ain\\'t that. (My Texas bleeds through when I want to make sure y\\'all\\'re listening.)\\n\\nWhen I was in the agenting business many long yars ago, an ancestor of this story came across my desk. I loved it. I loved its vernacular honesty and I loved its visceral reality. I wanted to make people read it...stop them in the halls of our building and say \"just this bit right here! you\\'ll love it!\" and I was talked out of it. See, I\\'m white, and male, and even then that meant my privilege wasn\\'t going to sail that beautifully loud sound-cloud out onto the lakes of white-people culture. Publishing might be doing better, but it\\'s still the world where I was told to my face by an editor about a non-fiction book by and about African-Americans (as the polite term was then) I wanted her to buy, \"who will buy it? Black people don\\'t read.\"\\n\\nThirty years on I\\'m still appalled by that memory.\\n\\nAnd thus it\\'s extra delightful to me that I\\'m reading this auspicious debut from a young Black creator with the colophon of a very, very distinguished house that made its cultural capital a century ago by taking just these sorts of chances. ( won\\'t mean much to most of y\\'all, but he was quite a noise on the 1917 Knopf list....) I couldn\\'t do it; someone could, though, and that it\\'s taken this long to make the waves it\\'s already making (LitHub loves it, forevermore! That\\'s Establishment imprimatur enough right there!) is, well, for me personally both validating and frustrating. I wish I\\'d done it; I\\'m thrilled it\\'s been done.\\n\\nDon\\'t deny yourself this treat. I can\\'t say I liked a whole lot, but it was a clarion call, a loud voice in full cry, saying, \"there\\'s a new way to do this!\" That\\'s what is, that loud voice. Spend some extra time with her and learn what will make you sad to know.',\n",
       " 'Wow! Mottley did not hold back in this one, and I’m certainly grateful to be exposed to the uncomfortable truth that is desperately needed to be told.\\n\\nSome of us will probably never relate to what Kiara went through in these pages, but it’s the reality of many young girls in this system. We can tell that she grows up way too fast as she shoulders responsibilities a teenager should never have. She and her brother both find ways to cope with their broken family, which unfortunately creates conflict between them for most of the book, revealing how these situations continue to drive the family further apart.\\n\\nThere are many uncomfortable scenes in this one that had me hurting in my soul. To think that these events are inspired by true events is indeed very harrowing. Once you enter into the kind of world that Kiara is forced into, it is a struggle to get out of and this is explored throughout the book. It didn’t get easier. Kiara’s interactions with other people in this book were a great part of this story because it assured us that Kiara was still a human being with a whole life. Mottley also does a great job of including many aspects of the system that allows events like this to persist.\\n\\nThe ending was not what I hoped for, but was oddly what I exactly needed. At the end of the day, circumstances might never change or only get slightly better, but it’s internal peace that one discovers that helps them get through it all.\\n\\nI would highly recommend!',\n",
       " \"4.5 rounded up\\n\\nOakland, Ca. Seventeen year old jobless Kiara (Kia) Johnson lives with her brother at the Regal-Hi. It sounds glamorous but its so far from that in its squalid, run down, high rent grubbiness. She lives with her brother Marcus who has delusions of making it big as a rapper which means no money is coming at all. She's worried, she's frustrated, she has to get a job but she has no resume so she's trapped. She does what she has to do in order to survive, in other words, nightcrawling. The inevitable vulnerability leads to her becoming ensnared by those more powerful than herself. This is based on a true story of a major scandal of sexual exploitation by members of the Oakland PD, though the character of Kiara is entirely fictional.\\n\\nThis novel stuns you in several ways. First of all, the way it's written is amazing as the quality of the prose is outstanding. The author makes you feel what Kia feels and I can hear her voice via the dialogue. She's a survivor with a heart of gold. Secondly, you are stunned by the horrifying and shocking abuse, how a human being is treated like trash and is powerless to do anything about it as the system is stacked against her. The injustice angers and sickens you. Thirdly, the author started writing this book when SHE WAS 17!!! What a phenomenal talent has just emerged, I'm in awe of her literary ability as it's so accomplished.\\n\\nThis is a debut of raw honesty, it's very powerful as not only does it demonstrate the grinding poverty and mouth to mouth existence that some people have to live day to day but it reveals the rotten underbelly and corruption of the justice system and how it's manipulated by those who should know better. It's obviously a very dark topic but it's extremely moving, compelling and devastatingly heartbreaking. I really like the way it ends - there is some hope, I have my fingers crossed.\\n\\nOverall, I can't deny this is a tough read but it's one I recommend for the sheer quality of the writing and with what it reveals.\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Bloomsbury Publishing PLC for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\",\n",

Telling her would have been like saying this is my life now, like committing to the streets. Letting the streets have you is like planning your own funeral. I wanted the streetlight brights, the money in the morning, not the back alleys. Not the sirens. But, here we are. Streets always find you in the daylight, when you least expect them to. Night crawling up to me when the sun\\'s out.\\n\\n\\nTo write an accomplished literary novel at the age of 19 is an impressive feat. For it not to be (as one might thing) autobiographical but instead based on a real life example of insitutionalised misconduct (here by the Oakland Police Force) and aimed at giving a voice to the voiceless victims even more so. But to do that with such an originality of phrase and language in a way which not just gives that voice (here a seventeen year old) a level of articulation, but also effectively confronts the structural sexism by disassembling conventional writing is I think close to astonishing.\\n\\nThe book’s protagonist is Kiara Johnson. Her father was later in life a Black Panther, stitched up by the police and jailed he died of undiscovered cancer some time after his release. Her devastated mother is in a halfway home on parole after an attempted suicide which followed the drowning of Kiara’s baby sister due to neglect. Kiara’s older brother – who initially committed to looking after her – has instead focused all his efforts on an attempt to break through as a rapper, his and his friends lack of talent leading them instead to increasing involvement in crime. Kaira is also babysitter and effective care giver to a 9-10 year old Trevor – the largely abandoned son of a junkie in her flat.\\n\\nThe book opens with Kiara receiving a notice of a huge hike in the rent she and her brother can already not cover – and struggling to make any headway with a job, she drifts into prostitution and from there to servicing a group of policemen (anonymous to her and us and only known by their badge numbers) at a series of parties.\\n\\nWhen one of the policemen commits suicide and names his guilt over his treatment of her in his note – a major misconduct enquiry kicks off, but this only makes Kiara’s life harder as the police force closes ranks to protect its own and to discredit her testimony in front of a Grand Jury and both her brother and Trevor are swept up in the aftermath.\\n\\nAs an aside the book opens with an excrement filled swimming pool – which made me worry we had an other Ottessa, more Moshfegh – but that was far from the case, Leila Mottley is a much more accomplished writer, and the pool rather than gratuitous scatology is instead a recurring and important image in the book – representing a sense of frustrated and fouled up freedom and friendship.\\n\\nSo why not a five star review. Well to be honest the voice did not really quite work for me. I always have a slight issue with novels where the writer is from a more privileged educational background than their protagonist and yet gives that protagonist an unusual eloquence. But I think the larger issue here is that the book seems to permanently be dialled up to a 10 and unlike Nigel Tufnel and his famous Marshall amplifier () it leaves her with no where to go to add additional emphasis.\\n\\nAnd perhaps as a corollary to this – for a novel which is largely around getting us into the head of a memorable narrator, I felt myself always slightly distanced from her, the author at times I think favouring phraseology over clarity.\\n\\nBut overall while far from flawless, this is I believe the first novel of what will be a famous and fresh new voice in fiction, and worth reading for that alone.',\n",
       " \"Now Nominated for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel 2023\\nLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2022\\nAt 20, Mottley could become the youngest contender to ever win the Booker: Growing up the daughter of an author, she started writing this debut aged 16, because she wanted to tell a story representing Black girlhood with a complex, vibrant protagonist - and she succeeded. Young Kiara grows up in the projects of Oakland, her father, an ex-Panther and ex-convict, has passed away, the mother is in a halfway house after a suicide attempt and a stint in jail. Her beloved brother Marcus dreams of making it out of poverty by becoming a famous musician, and Kiara is stuck with the role of provider - but what is a 17-year-old high school drop-out supposed to do? Right: She sells her body.\\n\\nFor Mottley, the pressure on Black women to take care of men and their communities and how that expectation can crush them is a key topic of her text. The novel, set in 2015, was also inspired by that was uncovered in Oakland during that time, and which the then-teenage author was following in the media. But while the story is mostly grim, including paragraphs and conversations brimming with doom and several graphic scenes of rape and other forms of physical as well as emotional violence, the story also highlights the power of solidarity between people. Mottley refrains from reducing her protagonist to a mere victim cliché and gives her a rich inner life, individuality, and thus dignity.\\n\\nThe language is very precise, the descriptions are apt and the evocations of moods work pretty well. Still, the story didn't really grab me: It partly felt rather slow-moving and lengthy to me, some important scenes towards the end (which I will not spoil) felt too hasty, while others were too drawn out. All in all though, I'm looking forward to reading more novels by Mottley, because she is a writer of great talent with an important agenda.\\n\\nYou can listen to Mottley talking to Seth Meyers , and to Trevor Noah (kudos to those two for frequently inviting interesting writers to their late night shows!).\",\n",
       " \"There's a geeky pleasure in discovering connections between authors so when Ruth Ozeki described in her speech after winning this year's Women's Prize for Fiction that her student Leila Mottley's “Nightcrawling” was just published, it made me even more eager to read this debut novel. It was a delight to find that it's a book worthy of all the buzz it's been getting as it is so moving, impactful and skilfully written – especially for an author who has only just turned twenty years old. It follows the story of Kiara who is seventeen at the start of the novel and lives with her brother Marcus in a run-down apartment complex in Oakland, California. They're in danger of being evicted because of rent increases and it entirely falls to Kiara to gather the money since her father is dead, her mother is absent and Marcus is more focused on trying to launch a music career rather than finding paid work. Since she didn't finish high school and doesn't have a resume, her options are extremely limited and she becomes a prostitute. However, when she's cornered by the police she's ensnared in a situation where she is frequently taken advantage of and abused. The narrative steeps us in Kiara's perspective and journey through this harrowing situation in a way which is so vivid and striking, but also artfully illuminates wider issues concerning the danger and violence experienced by many Black girls and Black women in America.\\n\\nPart of what makes this such an arresting tale is that it is based on a real case from recent years and it's one that Mottley read about when she was Kiara's age. Being a character so close to her age and one who is from the same city gives a real authenticity to the voice of the character. She's entirely fictional but the way the author portrays her complex psychology and development makes her multi-dimensional. More than this it's written in a way which highlights the many issues at stake which could lead a young American girl to being the victim of such an atrocious crime. We are entirely locked in Kiara's point of view yet can see from what she witnesses how the police systematically abuse their power and the difficulty of making the perpetrators accountable. Through her struggle we're made aware why so many cases of abuse go unreported and aren't brought to justice and how there isn't enough support for the most vulnerable citizens in this country. Additionally, the story shows how the innate intelligence and artistic talent of many young people isn't developed because of the circumstances they struggle under and the concept that if something isn't profitable it isn't worth pursuing.\\n\\nRead my full\",\n",
       " \"Longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize\\n\\nLeila Mottley's debut novel Nightcrawling fictionalizes an all too-real story of police brutality and exploitation of a young Black girl in Oakland, California. Kiara is 17 years old when the story begins. She lives with her older brother in a rundown apartment complex and just trying to make ends meet. She also often looks after her neighbor, a 9 year old book named Trevor whose mother, Dee, is a drug addict and neglects him. In the course of the novel, Kiara gets caught up in sex work that pulls her into a high profile court case with the Oakland police department.\\n\\nThe truths in this book that Mottley explores, as she excellently states in the Author's Note, about the adultification of young Black girls and the prioritization of Black men over their female family members are highlighted really well in this novel. Mottley's ability to craft emotion and bring you into Kiara's heart and mind shows a lot of skill for such a young writer (I only note her age here because SO much of the discourse around this book has been about the fact that she started writing this at 17 and is now the youngest person ever longlisted for the Booker prize at 20 years old).\\n\\nNevertheless, I had a lot of issues with the writing in this book. As a debut from a young writer, and positioning it especially against other authors on the Booker Prize longlist this year, it reads as a first novel. The sentence structure at times is so clunky and awkward, I found myself re-reading certain paragraphs just to make sure I didn't miss a detail or some word earlier in the sentence that would provide the context I felt I lacked. This happened multiple times, from the first chapter onward. I also had heard from others who had read it before me that this was 'flowery' or 'purple prose,' and while I do think she leans more into the poetic, literary writing style (which I'm fine with and definitely enjoy when done well), it felt more like she used two words where one word would suffice, a little too often. It became really noticeable and distracting the more the story went on.\\n\\nAlong with the somewhat awkward writing style, there were reveals or pieces of information doled out at times that felt jarring compared to the context of that particular moment. Without spoiling anything, there's something that happens with Kiara's mom that is explained to the reader over the course of the novel that is confusing and feels a bit misleading or purposefully vague until the 'right' time to let them in on what exactly happened. When it's first introduced, I genuinely thought I may have missed important details because I was so caught off guard by the reveal that it didn't even feel like a purposeful reveal. There were also scenes (like when Kiara goes to see her mom) that utilized a character reciting a huge monologue of past events to tell the reader something important that didn't feel natural to what two people who have a shared history would talk about. It's these sort of choices that felt a bit unnatural and awkward that took me out of the story and dampened the reading experience for me.\\n\\nWhile I didn't hate this book by any means, I think the hype around it has definitely done it a disservice in my eyes. I think Mottley is a good storyteller, with a strong voice and style all her own (and if it works for you, I think you will really like this book! So many people have). From my perspective, with a different editor I think this book could have been way stronger and even more impactful. I appreciated the story, I enjoyed Kiara as a character and following her journey, but the delivery of that information on a sentence level left something to be desired.\",\n",

       " 'First of all I should say that I agree with everything this author is saying politically. This is a book about the disturbingly warped relationship between the police and the people they are supposed to protect. On the surface, it’s a stark portrait of poverty, racism, sexual violence, and the broken social system in America. Of course I agree that this is a really important topic and it’s a good thing that stories like this are being celebrated.\\n\\nBut this book left a bad taste in my mouth. It’s based on the real-life case of Celeste Guap, who was sexually assaulted by a network of police officers in Oakland. The case was a shocking miscarriage of justice, mishandled in every possible way, even the way in which it was reported in the media, and a fictionilisation focusing on the victim is a wonderful concept for a novel.\\n\\nThe problem is, Mottley’s “humanisation” of this neglected victim (in the book her name is Kiara) is not entirely convincing. At least, for me it wasn’t. Kiara is a perfectly virtuous, naive Mary Sue who occasionally gets angry about all the injustice being inflicted upon her. As a narrator, she seems all too generic—I never got the sense of the distinctive voice of a real person.\\n\\nPart of this is probably caused by the writing style. The way Kiara speaks (“Got a gig but it don’t pay much and they raising our rent”) is completely different to her internal narrative voice, which is just garden-variety creative-writing-degree prose. I was surprised to see other reviewers raving about the writing, as it struck me as pretty heavy on cliches, and sometimes very clunky.\\n\\nOverall, I don’t think is as empathetic or as authentic as it claims to be. Though it purports to give voice to one woman’s real-life experience, in reality it seems like a sanitised, easily-digestible fantasy of what that experience might have been—a moralistic performance of empathy that erases the individual supposedly being empathised with.',\n",

After finishing the novel, I found myself intrigued by three stories: the author\\'s tale, the novel itself, and the 2016 case that inspired the book.\\n\\nThe Author: Who is Leila Mottley?\\n\\nLeila Mottley was born in 2002 and, at 20, is considered a rising star on the literary scene. She grew up in Oakland and is the youngest of three children of a biracial couple Ann Bauer, the Director of a local pre-school, and Norris Mottley, a fundraising consultant, and playwright. Leila learned her love of writing from her father and began writing poetry at an early age.\\n\\nHer interest in the writing led Leila to enroll at Oakland School for the Arts, a 6-12 charter school emphasizing arts education. Here Leila\\'s poetic talents were recognized by her teachers, who encouraged her to apply to the competition for the poet laureate of the city of Oakland, a title she won in 2018. As a result, Leila began to give poetry readings and participate in poetry slams throughout the city.\\n\\nWhen Leila was fourteen, in 2016, the story of the teenage sex worker exploited by the local police broke in the news. The story moved her, and she followed it with great interest. Then, in her senior year, Leila began to write a novel about a young black woman who became trapped in this situation. When Leila entered Smith College in the fall of 2019, she showed the story to her creative writing instructor, Ruth Ozeki. She recognized the book\\'s potential and referred Leila to her literary agent. After a bidding war, the novel was picked up by Knopf publishing.\\n\\nThe Novel: Nightcrawling\\n\\nNightcrawling is the story of Kiara Johnson, a 17-year-old African- American Oakland teenager whose options have run out. Both of her parents are out of the picture. Her father, a former Black Panther, died of prostrate cancer upon release from prison. Her mother is in a halfway house for drowning her infant daughter. Oakland is gentrifying, and the rent on the apartment Kiara shares with her older brother has just been doubled.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, her brother has decided to pursue a career as a rap star and refuses to work. In addition, Kiara cares for and provides a semblance of stability for her next-door neighbor Trevor, the 9-year-old son of an unreliable drug addict. As Kiara is a high school dropout, she has difficulty finding work and decides to turn a few tricks to make rent and food for the month. Unfortunately, Kiara is caught by two unscrupulous cops who threaten her with arrest unless she provides sex at police parties. She complies, and the abuse is brutal. Then, one of the officers involved commits suicide and names her in a tell-all suicide note. Internal affairs get involved, and Kiara\\'s life spirals further out of control as she becomes the key witness in a massive police scandal.\\n\\nWhen Nightcrawling was longlisted for the Booker, I decided to read it or rather listen to it on audible. I was interested in finding out what had inspired a group of critics to select the work of a 17- year- old for such a prestigious award. I finished the book two days ago, and I think that what makes the book work or what made it work for me was the authenticity of the protagonist\\'s voice. What Leila Mottley understands is what it is like to be an adolescent. This book could have easily become a work of sordid sensationalism, but it doesn\\'t. Sad, abusive scenes are followed by segments demonstrating friendship and resilience. There are happy and tender moments with the nine-year-old Trevor and with her best friend.\\n\\nI didn\\'t feel that Nightcrawling was a great work of literary fiction. It doesn\\'t compare to a book like Shuggie Bain, which won the Booker two years ago. However, it is quite an accomplishment for a 17-year-old, and I look forward to reading her future work.\\n\\nThe Case that Inspired the Novel or Truth is Stranger than Fiction (Forgive the Cliché)\\n\\nWhen I finished the novel, I googled the 2016 Oakland police scandal. I found the story of Celeste Guap ((pseudonym). Celeste\\'s family is originally from Nicaragua. Her mother worked as a police dispatcher for the Oakland Police, earning over $100,000. Celeste\\'s mother was involved with a police officer who was like a father to Celeste. Unfortunately, he was killed in the line of duty when she was 12. After his death, she began to occasionally exchange sex for money. In a newspaper interview, Celeste said that she did it because it was \"all around her.\" She made connections via social media and slept with three police officers as a minor.\\n\\nCeleste believes that none of what happened to her would have occurred if her mother\\'s boyfriend had been alive. She claims he would never have allowed it. However, she was coerced into providing sex to multiple partners at police parties. Unbeknown to her mother, several of the officers involved were her \" friends.\"\\n\\nWhen one of the officers committed suicide and named her in his confession. Like her fictional counterpart, Celeste became the center of a police scandal. A few officers lost their jobs, and others just received reprimands. Celeste sued the Department and received a million dollars in compensation with no liability. She is now 23, lives with her two-year-old son, and works as a Sex Workers\\' Rights Activist. On her Facebook page, Celeste was asked about the book Nightcrawling. She said, \"It\\'s pure fiction.\"\\n\\nNPR News Account:',\n",

All Marcus is thinking about is launching his music career, leaving all the hard work of money earning to Kiara. The girl has to do something so they won’t be evicted from their apartment. Being a high school dropout with no resume makes it even more difficult for her to get a job. One night, something happens to Kiara, which leads her to become a prostitute as a last resort. We follow her story, her struggle, and all the hardships this black girl endures.\\n\\nThis is a good debut novel for a 19-year-old author (her age when she wrote it). I think Leila Mottley will have a strong career if she continues writing on hard-hitting subjects like this. Being picked by Oprah's book club is a big recognition in itself. Then the book successfully made it to the longlist for the Booker Prize. So there is a lot going on for this author.\\n\\nThe story is gripping and deals with dark subjects. The characters are quite strong too. The writing was sometimes poetic and, at other times, it felt too descriptive and different. I am not sure how to explain it, but it is apparent that the author has written this at different stages of her life. There is a polarity between the chapters when it comes to the writing. At times, this novel might disturb you because what you are reading about are things that actually happen in our world. So beware of the trigger warnings because they are many.\",\n",

The fact that it is based on a real life case makes this novel more powerful. Of course, it's horrific that the police, who are supposed to protect and respect the law, disregard it, not to mention the ick and moral considerations - using a seventeen-year-old for sex parties.\\n\\nThe narrator of this novel is seventeen year old, Kiara Johnson, who had been dealt bad cards in life - her father passed away, her mother is in jail, and her guardian, her older brother is a lost, head-in-the-sky dreamer, who can't help to pay the rent. The rent is put up yet again, there are no jobs to come by, so what's one to do? Start night crawling.\\n\\nI appreciate Mottley's intentions and writing, to be honest, I wasn't quite as affected by the novel as I should have been. Something was missing. Grittiness (is that a word?)? Throughout the novel, I felt distanced from what was happening to the characters - I could always sense the author's hand and viewpoints when writing beautiful, impressive sentences, which I didn't quite believe as they were supposed to come from a teen who hadn't finished high school.\\n\\nWhile I'm not one to care about endings, I don't expect books to have nicely wrapped endings, in this case, the last part of the novel and the ending felt rushed, unbaked and left me unsatisfied.\\n\\nRegardless of the fact that I wanted a bit more from this novel, Mottley showcased her talent in this novel, so I'm looking forward to reading more from her.\",\n",

She went to La Guardia High School concentrating on Visual Arts and by default decided to follow a path in Fashion Design at Fashion Institute of Technology. During those four years of college, she worked as a salesperson, manager and then window designer in an upscale Madison Ave. boutique. In 1993, four of her children stories were featured on BET's Story Porch. Soon after, she gave up her fashionista lifestyle to become a full-time college student at SUNY Binghamton where her love affair with literature and history began. She graduated from the NYU, MFA program in 1999. Her passion for literature fueled her desire to be active in community. In 1997, she co-founded WILL: Women In Literature & Letters with Adelina Anthony and Marta Lucia, an organization that produced readings, workshops, and a conference using literature as a tool to build community and transform society. In 2000, WILL was put on hold due to lack of resources and the women's desire to make more time to write. Angie Cruz has contributed shorter works to numerous periodicals including Latina Magazine, Callaloo and New York Times. She has won awards for her writing and/or activist work such as The New York Foundation of The Arts Fellowship, Barbara Deming Award, Yaddo, and The Camargo Fellowship.

The result is a one sided conversation with Cara pretty much telling her life story to the counselor and of course to the reader. We also are are privy to her responses to various questionnaires, some were sad and others made me laugh out loud. She exudes an amazing confidence and self awareness as she talks about her life, why she left the Dominican Republic, about her son who left, her best friend, her sister and others, what she has been doing since being unemployed and what is happening with the rentals in her building.

In How Not to Drown in a Glass of Water, we follow Cara Romero, a Dominican immigrant living in New York City, who goes to career counseling after getting laid off from her factory job. Over 12 sessions with her career counselor, Cara reveals the story of her life, including her abusive ex-romantic partners and mother, her struggle to pay rent in a rapidly gentrifying city, and her estranged relationship with her son.\\n\\nI found that the unique setup of this book worked. It’s rare that a novel told in second person doesn’t feel gimmicky to me, yet with this novel, Cara’s voice came across as authentic, funny, and full of energy. I think Angie Cruz’s use of vivid details and her consistency with the way Cara described both external events and her own emotions helped the book come alive. Though at times humorous, touches on several important and oftentimes harrowing topics: abuse, gentrification, and discrimination against immigrants. I found the theme of intergenerational trauma the most poignant part of the novel, especially witnessing the separation of a son and his mother from the perspective of the mother, who hurt him.\\n\\nI think the tightness of the prose loosened a little in the middle of the book which shifted my rating to four stars, however, I still enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to those interested in literary fiction.',\n",

It would have been interesting also, to hear the young counselor's reactions to Cara.\\n\\nI was more sympathetic to Cara during the first half of the story. She had been abused first by her mother and then by her husband. She left them behind in the Dominican Republic to carve out a better life for herself and her young son in the U.S. Later in the story, Cara regretfully divulged that she herself, had been abusive towards her son and nephew on occasion.\\n\\nCara emerges as a passionate woman with strong attachments to her son, sister and neighbors in the apartment building. She finds the time to cook dinner every night for an elderly neighbor, pick up her sister's children from school and look after them, and help a mother in the building with her disabled middle-aged daughter. She is also sly like a fox.

There are also issues of racism, immigration and support systems the book references. The book is told entirely from Cara’s perspective (including sessions with a job counsellor) and I found her musings and responses to be pretentious.

More than that, however, in each of the sessions, she gives her counselor far more than she bargained for in hearing about her life.\\n\\nCara tells her counselor about her early life in the Dominican Republic, the marriage that made her flee to the U.S. She talks about her best friend, Lulú, and her difficult relationship with her sister, Ángela, who resents her for many things. But what plagues her the most is that her son, Fernando, abandoned her. She was just being a good mother and trying to protect him and toughen him up so the world didn’t take advantage of him.

Along for the ride are DCI Donna deFreitas and DCI Chris Hudson, lovable Bogdan, and an ever-growing cast of old and new characters.\\n\\nIt was fun to see love in the air for a few of these characters interspersed with the more dramatic scenarios some of them found themselves in. I’m not going to deep-dive into the plot since so many reviews have already been written, but the plot included a TV show, a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency, a shady character named “The Viking”, an old KGB colonel from Elizabeth’s past, missing money, the hilarious drug-dealing menace, Connie, from the last book, murder, and more of the general twisty-turny mayhem you’ve come to expect from this bunch.\\n\\nIt’s cozy, it’s fun, it’s charming, and it’s positive age representation at its best!

Helping them are their friends PC Donna de Freitas and DCI Chris Hudson. To complicate matters for Elizabeth, she is receiving anonymous texts and threats from an unknown nemesis who orders her to kill a former KGB colonel she had connections with during her old days as an MI5 agent, failing which would endanger not only her life but also the life of one of her friends.\\n\\nWhat follows is an exciting sequence of events involving a multitude of suspects (old and new), the world of television journalism, financial fraud, kidnapping, murder, blackmail and much more. People are killed, graves are dug, unlikely alliances and friendships are formed, romance blossoms for some of the characters and while some mysteries are solved, there is much more to the story than what everyone assumes.\\n\\nI love how the author not only entertains us with riveting mysteries but also pays attention to character development as the series progresses. Each of the characters has an important role to play in these stories. Elizabeth is a very interesting character and we get to know more about her past while also witnessing the love and tenderness she feels for her husband Stephen and her concern for her friends. Joyce is definitely coming into her own as the series progresses and I loved how she uses her presence of mind to get out of the sticky situations. Her journal entries/notes make for some entertaining reading. In addition to the third-person narrative and Joyce’s notes, I liked we also get chapters from the perspectives of Elizabeth, Bogdan, Ibrahim and other characters.

When they’re on the prowl, they’re going to get their way. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, she’s also dealing with a personal issue when someone from her past threatens her future. She’s reluctant to share this with her friends, but by keeping it to herself…is she putting them in danger?\\n\\nI cannot get enough of this series, and I can honestly say that each book gets better and better! I loved learning more about the characters we’ve come to love. There are some new dynamics that keep things really exciting…and put a big ‘ol smile on my face. There are also new characters who are highly interesting. And let’s not forget about the crime(s) and case(s) that the Thursday Murder Club is determined to solve. It’s highly intriguing, and I think fans of the series will really be impressed with the direction it’s going.\\n\\nThere are plenty of laughs to be had, and I am already eagerly awaiting the next installment.

I haven’t had the pleasure of being with the four septuagenarian sleuths in a long time.\\n\\nEveryone has their favorite character, and mine is retired MI6 Agent Elizabeth Best. The woman is a hoot. Joyce Meadowcroft is a retired nurse, and Ibrahim Arif a renown psychiatrist. The fourth member is Ron Ritchie, a union organizer. The four get themselves involved in a cold case, money laundering, tax evasion scheme that resulted in an unsolved murder. An ex-KGB spy and an eccentric, jailed, drug dealer round out the band of major characters.\\n\\nThe joy of reading Osman’s novel is being immersed in the antics the characters get themselves into. Osman’s prose is clever and hysterically funny. Yes, it’s fun to try and solve the mysteries, but the true delight is being a part of their inner musings, the hijinks they get themselves into.\\n\\nI listened to the audio, narrated by Fiona Shaw.

Ron will be interviewed for a piece on “retirement living” and then the gang will invite Mike to join them for dinner and serve him enough red wine to hopefully loosen his tongue.\\n\\nBethany had been investigating a huge VAT fraud involving mobile phones that had made millions for Heather Garbutt and Jack Mason.

It’s obvious a lot of thought goes into these plots, and the intrigue is always absorbing.\\n\\nThe one small gripe I have is that this one might have run a little too long, and occasionally the pacing lagged, just a tiny bit- but of course, there is always something going on and my attention was never divided- it just felt like it took me a while to finish the book, this time around. But that’s a very small quibble.\\n\\nOther than that, this series shows no signs of slowing down. The characters are still sharp, the poignancy is still a big undercurrent that offsets the zaniness, and the plots get better and stronger as the series progresses.\\n\\nOnce again, I feel it should be stressed that while this series often lands in the cozy category, anyone who loves mysteries or crime fiction will like this series.

After the rush.” “Please, call me Mike,” says Mike. “And, no, I’m afraid. I try not to mix with people. You know, privacy, germs, whatnot. You understand, I’m certain.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth is receiving anonymous texts that culminate in a threat: kill a former love and KGB agent or face deathly consequences.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a typically convoluted story that eventually has people happily pairing off, working together, and generally becoming best versions of themselves. (Or are they?)\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought it was a lot of fun, but I mostly just treat it like an amuse-bouche; something to enjoy and feel good about, without putting a great deal of thought into its components. I'm not going to be a downer and point them out; besides, Osman kind of does that for us:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere's actually no shortage of the finely aged sleuth in mysteries. Jane Marple (1927-1976) was one of the most famous, of course. Mrs. Polifax came along later, (1966-2000) bringing the international spy angle, only obviously elderly and prone to kindness instead of athleticism. Osman does a nice job maintaining bemusement at the age incongruity of the team, but on the sliding scale of 'realistic,' I'd move it away from Marple and push it towards the adventuresome Polifax: unlikely but engaging.\",\n",

This apparently normal research turns into a maelstrom of death threats, murders both real and pretend, money laundering and suicide. Elizabeth gets to fire her gun and Joyce demonstrates remarkable cool in a very dangerous encounter.\\n\\nI loved the development of all the characters and especially enjoyed the pairing of Bogdan and Donna. There are many humorous moments between and about all of the characters, but there are sad moments too. The progress of Stephen's dementia is very realistic and is especially heart breaking now that he is beginning to be more aware that something is wrong.\\n\\nNever forget that the members of the Thursday Murder Club are all over seventy and retired.

Such a shame!\\n\\nThere\\'s romance in the air for a few of our characters and the humor is at its best. Joyce is still writing in her diary, with her loyal pooch Alan by her side, which is always a highlight in this series for me.

I do believe Joyce and Ibrahim are my favorites and I love how Bogdan always takes such good care of Elizabeth\\'s husband Stephen. He\\'s such a fine chap!\\n\\nThe audiobook narrator Fiona Shaw makes a wonderful effort with gender voicing and delivering the appropriate voice inflections with the dialog to ensure a consistent listening experience, especially when it comes to the hints of humor.

       " \"The 3rd installment of this popular cozy mystery series does not disappoint as the entire gang (Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron & Ibrahim) are back as they try and solve a 10-year old death of a TV news reporter whose car went over a cliff into the sea. No body was ever found but this does not discourage the group, who is now aided by a Polish construction worker, a TV news presenter, a TV makeup artist, the former head of the Leningrad KGB, a cryptocurrency money launder, and members of the police department, and even a criminal who they put behind bars in Book 2. Whew! But each brings different strengths to the investigation. And, as with most of these books, one murder leads to more murders and attempted murders, as the plot thickens and the gang gets closer to finding out the truth. Fast paced, action packed (especially since the Thursday Murder Club members are all in their 80's), and is a very good addition to this series. Negatives: I thought the author got so caught up in the ending of the book that he left some loose ends to a few of the plot lines. Other than that, this is a wonderful read and perfectly sets up the next book in the series.\\nSee my full review of this and other books at\",\n",

She was previously a spook with Britain’s MI5, and when she was looking into a cold case recently, she called on three friends from her retirement village for help. Together, they are the Thursday Murder Club.\\n\\nIbrahim Arif is a psychiatrist, still analysing everyone. Ron Ritchie is an old union organiser, always on the lookout for trouble and not afraid of finding it. Joyce Meadowcroft – gentle, naïve, Joyce – is their secretary and diarist.\\n\\nJoyce’s diary ‘narrates’ some chapters, where she expresses joy at the surprising things she’s learning how to do (like how to post photos on Instagram), and where she summarises the action so far. Some readers find her voice annoying.\\n\\nI think she is a hoot, plus – as Elizabeth notes – she may be naïve, but that isn’t the same as stupid She is smart and has great instincts for ferreting things out.\\n\\nIn this adventure, she gets to meet celebrities, about which she is over the moon. The group is looking into the death of an attractive TV co-host ten years ago, when her car was found at the bottom of a cliff near Dover. The show is still running with the same main host, so Elizabeth and Joyce decide to attend as guests and sit in the front row.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the show investigation goes on, Ibrahim has been sent to interview a prisoner, Connie, who is a fearsome character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBogdan? Not our Bogdan Jankowski? He’s a regular friend of the group, a slightly younger Polish ‘associate’, you might say, who has been very helpful at digging up graves and such in the past. A handy chap, to say the least. Why does Connie want to kill him?\\n\\nOther ‘associates’ we’ve met before are Elizabeth’s beloved husband, Stephen, who has dementia but who can still win a mean game of chess against Bogdan – when he remembers he knows how to play. His now-and-then memory is useful, but Elizabeth despairs about his future.\\n\\nThe police, Chris and Donna, are regulars, as is Patrice, Donna’s mother. But I digress. Elizabeth has a job to do, and she has to find a way to do it – murder an old Russian foe. Excellent story.\\n\\nThis series is a delight to read, with appealing characters and murders new and old to solve. It’s hard to see some of the people struggling because of age or frailty, but the depth of camaraderie and support they offer each other is wonderful. I particularly enjoy the outlook each character has, courtesy of their own experiences over the decades.\\n\\nI hope they live forever!',\n",

There’s a dash or two of romance, more than a smidgen of mystery, a soupçon of thrill and more than a modicum of chuckles in the latest Thursday Murder Club series. We meet a South East news presenter, a makeup artist, a money launderer, a tough (?) Viking and a very likeable exKGB and now you know it’s fiction! However the standout character for me is …. Alan the dog and a big shout out for Bogdan!!\\n\\nRichard Osman writes such good cozy mysteries and I’m loathe to say it but I think the plot of this one is not quite as enjoyable as the first two though is still an entertaining ‘romp’! There was a definitely humour although perhaps again not as much as books one and two but there is still plenty of RO wit in evidence. I absolutely love the concept of the novels as the four main protagonists continue to grow old disgracefully and why not?? I am that’s for sure! I look forward to number four which I hope Mr O has in mind amongst his wedding plans!!! 💙❤️💜',\n",

But worries about his broken curfew transform into something much more dangerous when Todd finally emerges from the darkness. As Jen watches through the window, she sees her funny, seemingly happy teenage son stab a total stranger.\\n\\nShe doesn’t know who the victim is, or why Todd has committed such a devastating act of violence.

       " 'Wowza, this is an absolute mindblower. I’ve been a fan of Gilly McAllister for several years but in my opinion this is the best yet. My advice, don’t read the blurb, go in blind for greater enjoyment. All I’m going to say is that on day zero just after midnight Jen is anxiously waiting for her son Todd to come home. She spots him and shortly after her world stops turning. What follows on takes Jen on a journey of discovery after discovery.\\n\\nRight from the start the author pulls you into the storytelling with shock, horror, disbelief and tension being the tone set and maintained throughout. The concept of the novel is fantastic and very different from her previous novels, yet it’s also full of many clever twists and turns you don’t see coming which is one of her trademarks. It’s very well written, cleverly plotted, pitched perfectly so it just flows and in some ways it shouldn’t but it does, demonstrating real writing skill. Flow is an apt word as it is a go with the flow read and it does feel a bit weird to start with and you’re full of questions but somehow you just accept it conceptually and it comes to feel ‘natural’. I like the fact there are genre crossovers here and it works really well, deepening the mystery and sharpening the thrill element so much so you can’t put the book down. The central characters of Jen, son Todd and husband Kelly are very good and because you grow to like them so much (especially Todd) you go on an emotional journey with Jen as she beats herself up with maternal guilt but so much love for her son. The game at play is a dangerous one and it’s a rollercoaster ride as she makes some shocking discoveries in this voyage of second chances.\\n\\nWell played Gilly McAllister, what a book and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if movie rights or a Netflix miniseries offers wing their way with this one. The best yet and an easy five stars.\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Penguin Michael Joseph for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.',\n",

Her latest being no exception.\\n\\nJen witnesses her teenage son Todd murder a complete stranger - an older man. Todd’s victim has lost his life and so has Todd really - his promising future over before it’s begun. Jen is completely devastated, doesn’t know how she can go forward after this. The following morning, Jen finds herself not on the morning after the crime, but the morning BEFORE it happened! If she can go back in time, can she learn enough to prevent this crime from happening at all?\\n\\nWell this was certainly different, and there were so many twists I don’t know if I’m on my head or my heels! What a cleverly structured plot. How on earth Ms McAllister kept track of this and made it all fit I do not know, but just like that exceptionally difficult jigsaw puzzle, it all fits perfectly in the end. Just like a magician, Ms McAllister was pointing her readers in one direction, when we should have been looking in another direction altogether!\\n\\n*Thank you to Netgalley and Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC, in exchange for an honest unbiased review *',\n",

The police take Todd into custody for the murder.\\n\\nThe readers will be perplexed, just like Jen, as they don't know what is happening in Jen's life. To make things complicated for Jen, she finds out that her life is going in reverse order, and she is time traveling to the previous day every time she wakes up in the morning.\\n\\nJen decides to find out the details about the stranger who was murdered. She embarks on a challenging yet exciting journey into the past to unravel the mystery behind everything that happened.\\n\\nI am happy that I picked up this book to read, which has multiple themes embedded in it and multiple genre crossovers. Almost the whole book is written in reverse order. I found all the books and movies (including the latest Christopher Nolan movie, Tenet) that are created in reverse order fascinating. The author succeeded in making the readers curious to know how far a mother will go to save his son.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe author tells us that is the most important gift that parents can bestow upon their children. We can see Jen wondering how she managed to raise a child who is ready to murder another person.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was so happy to read from an article written by the author that the writing of this book changed the whole outlook of the author towards motherhood which made her decide to have a baby. This book also has the power to influence the reader's perspective regarding the beautiful relationship between mother and children.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many classifications of liars. Generally, we can classify them into\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, there are different types of lies and deception techniques\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are aware of these techniques used by liars, you can easily detect liars. The polygraph test is also used for detecting liars in certain investigations. Some perfect liars tell lies more convincingly than the facts. It is tough to detect their lies.\\n\\nIt might be scary to read that they even convincingly pass the polygraph test without getting caught. We can see how Jen catches a person lying convincingly only because she saw the future and is coming to the past from the future.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime travel will be something on everybody's bucket list. The author is trying to discuss something we have never considered regarding time travel.\\n\\nShe is trying to tell the painful aspects associated with it if you come from a family of liars. As you have already seen the future, it will be difficult for you to face the convincing lies your family members tell. How Jen's character is molded reveals why it is better not to time travel to your past if you are coming from such a family. The author beautifully depicts all the difficulties she faced due to the time travel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem with this book is that it takes some time for the reader to get accustomed to the author's writing style and how she crafted the book. Some readers might feel irritated when they start reading it as they won't understand what is happening in the initial part.\\n\\n\\nI think I bought this book at the right place and at the right time to read. It can be considered a thriller with sci-fi elements. There are no mind-bending concepts or extraordinary twists in this book. The author managed to write a complex topic in a simple, effective manner that is palatable to everyone.

       " '3.5 rounded up to a 4\\n\\nOne sentence review: A unique take on a domestic thriller that falls short due to an inane number of commas and questionable other writing style choices\\n\\nSYNOPSIS\\n\\nOn Oct. 29, Jen witnesses her 18-year-old son Todd stab a man outside their house. But when she wakes up the next day, it turns out to be the day prior. Jen begins to move back through time to discover what events led her son to become a killer, and hopefully stop it from happening in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you plan to read this, bundle your disbelief up and then YEEEEET it out the window. Time travel is the plot device du jour, so if you try to wrangle with the logistics of it all, you will most likely be hella annoyed. There simply is no rhyme nor reason to why she\\'s moving backwards, but it doesn\\'t matter – time travel is used to demonstrate how small seemingly insignificant details can add up to a disastrous event. That at every turn we can look a bit closer, see a bit more, get out in front of the consequences. Instead, we tend to fly through life in our own bubbles and then when the shoes drops, we\\'re forced to react. What if we could be so present that we could recognize the signs and be more proactive? To me, this is what the book was about. Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.\\n\\nWhat held this book back was the questionable grammatical and style choices made by the author. She was comma splicing herself into another dimension. And she missed the mark with the groups of threes by using THE SAME DAMN WORD three times in a row. Please ma\\'am. To be honest, the intricate plot and introspectiveness in the last half had me full-on Ray Charles to the comma splices. But objectively, an editor could\\'ve been used. Gillian, ima have to ask you to step the fuck away from the comma key on your keyboard. Just remove it entirely if you can\\'t resist using it.\\n\\nIn the first half, McAllister was doing entirely too much showing and trying to shove character traits down our throats. YES we understand that Kelly has dry wit and is anti-establishment. YES we get it, your father was repressed. YES we can see you struggle with parenting guilt. Thankfully after she stumbled through this first half, she really hit her stride. Homegirl was spittin motherhood AND marriage facts. And she even tapped into some \"telling\" that evoked many emotions – especially during the scene with her dad.\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s get to the plot. So, this book was fairly mass marketed along with some not-so-hot thrillers like The Golden Couple, Unmissing, Stay Awake, The Last Housewife etc. In comparison to these books (a fair comparison because the same marketing attention was doled out), this one stands head and shoulders above. Yes, at its core you have the regular degular domestic thriller is my husband a whackjob trope, but McAllister added complexity with the time travel element. She gave it a unique lens which I haven\\'t read this year.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, she did NOT go for cheap shock value or OTT shenanigans. McAllister stayed the course by dropping tidbits throughout and then tying everything together in a calm, cool, and collected fashion. In comparison, the aforementioned books slammed together as many illogical twisty twists as possible in the last 10%, which always annoys tf out of me. I hate when an author tries to bamboozle you into a positive rating by overwhelming you with drama. And thank fuck she didn\\'t toss in the \"catching up with a friend over coffee\" epilogue – you know the ones that summarize what everyone\\'s up to after the final act? So lazy.\\n\\nI have to say... the whole ordeal had me looking at my mans sideways because he acts the exact same: stoic, unemotional, free of any fucks to give. WELP LOL 😂\\n\\n\\n\\nPros: unique premise, thoughtfully executed and interesting plot, calm cool and collected ending, excellent use of a literary device, spittin some facts on motherhood and marriage\\n\\nCons: questionable grammar and style choices, took awhile to find its footing, not sure why she kept contacting Andy when he wasn\\'t giving her any science related advice LOL',\n",
       " \"By all rights Gillian McAllister's latest extraordinary and ingenious thriller should not work with its surprising travelling back in time premise, but it really is enthralling to observe how she pulls it off with style and panache. It is not often I give barely any details about a book, but this time, it is for the best. Jen finds herself living her worst nightmare when her teenage son, Todd, finds himself arrested for murdering a complete stranger. She goes to sleep distraught and in despair, only to wake up to find its the day before the horrifying events. As she travels further back in time, she is a mother looking for answers, how did this all come to happen, and more to the point, can she stop it happening? This is an intelligent and compulsive read as all the puzzling parts come together in a emotive, imaginative and unexpected story of twists and turns, so well written, and with characters that hold your interest, in what I think is her best novel to date.

       " 'I\\'m still conflicted on whether or not the audiobook was the way to go with this one. On the one hand, the narrator is fabulous and does a wonderful job inflecting various voices for the differing characters; on the other, it made it more difficult to keep up with the jumping timeline and easier to zone out on the more repetitive parts. Take from that what you will. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️\\n\\nis a clever novel of magical realistic suspense, and I\\'ve seen reviews all over the place on people\\'s thoughts, which I think automatically makes a book more appealing for me to try. I decided to jump in on The Traveling Friends buddy read, as I knew it was one I\\'d want to be able to discuss with others, and sure enough, it was a smart move. The synopsis leads you to believe that this is a Russian doll type of tale, and it would be correct, but I found myself in shock that the original mystery of the stabbing that occurs in chapter one isn\\'t really the overarching focus of the plot.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the Groundhog Day style of storytelling, although I think the middle began to drag a bit, and we go waaaaay back to the beginning of \"the story\" to finally figure out the \"secrets\" and \"mysteries\" of why this family is at the heart of a terrible crime where a mother has no warning as to why her beloved son would stab a seemingly strange man. Answers are given along the way, a few really nice twists that I probably should have seen coming, but didn\\'t, and overall I really liked how it wrapped up. I had to listen to the epilogue twice in order to decipher what was implied, because I forgot how one person tied into things, but that\\'s where having a group of buddies to discuss a book with comes in handy.\\n\\nWas it my favorite mystery of the year? Probably not, but I had a really great time reading it and discussing with the group. It felt nice to pick up a book with no expectations that I purchased on my own to break up the mountain of arcs I\\'m needing to catch up on, so I think it was well worth the Audible credit used. If you\\'re looking for a fast, popcorn type of read this one is great, so long as you dial in and don\\'t zone out while cooking dinner.',\n",
       " \"Very well done mystery story in the vein of Russian Doll (which I also loved). Even though I figured out what was going on long before it was revealed, the story was fast paced and kept me intrigued.\\n\\nThis unique story starts on Day Zero with Jen waiting for her eighteen-year-old son Todd to get home. She witnesses him stab and kill a man, and Jen and her husband Kelly are horrified when Todd is arrested. What would cause him to do such a thing? When Jen wakes up the next morning, there is Todd, not in jail, but eating breakfast like a regular day. She quickly realizes that she is one day earlier, and each night when she goes to sleep she travels back at least one day, sometimes more. Initially she is puzzled about why but she determines that there must be something she needs to do to stop Todd from stabbing the man.\\n\\nThere are plenty of surprises in this story and once I got into the swing of what was occurring (and once Jen accepted that it was taking place and stopped trying to figure out the how/why/trying to tell everyone around her what was happening) I was able to put on my puzzle solving hat and go with the flow of what Jen was trying to discover.\\n\\nWas this story perfect? No, there are some parts that didn't really make sense and by the end of the story I believed that Jen had lived the most clueless life possible, yet it was still incredibly fast paced and captivating. There are some fantastic twists revealed at deliberate intervals, and like I said above, although I figured many of them out ahead of time, this was still an entertaining and clever story.\\n\\nHighly recommended for those looking for a uniquely told mystery tale.\\n\\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\",\n",

       " 'I randomly picked up “Wrong Place Wrong Time” by Gillian McAllister at my local library. What a delightful surprise.\\n\\nThe premise is that a mother/lawyer witnesses her 18-year-old son murder a man in the front of their home. This is day zero, or more accurately, night zero. As one can imagine, Jen, the mother, is beside herself. Her son is arrested right in front of her for murdering a man who appears to be in his 40’s. Her son, Todd, is taken into police custody.\\n\\nJen wakes the next day, her mind in turmoil, trying to figure out what the heck happened. But surprisingly, it’s the day BEFORE the murder. The reader now learns about “The Bootstrap Paradox” which involves time travel, only backwards. You go back in time to observe an event that you caused that might have resulted in this unfortunate outcome. It’s a time loop, so to say.\\n\\nLucky for Jen, her best friend at work is friends with a renown physicist who specializes in this sort of “time travel”. We learn, along with Jen, what is involved in the Bootstrap Paradox. It’s a bit confusing. In her author’s notes, author McAllister wrote that she wanted a story to be like Russian nesting dolls, with something to learn with each paring down.\\n\\nI loved this writing technique. As a reader, I needed to use my brain backwards. You are given clues slowly, so slowly, yet in reverse. In fact, there is a place where she is so far removed from that date, that she even forgets what exactly she witnessed. She goes back seven thousand two hundred and thirty days!! Could you even remember if you randomly awoke at a date 5 years earlier? Or more? In fact, she goes back to before she even dated her husband.\\n\\nThis is a page-turner that kept me awake way past my bedtime. I thought this was going to be one of those domestic dramas of a mother feeling guilty about her bad parenting which leads to her son misbehaving. Isn’t that what everyone does, blame the mother? It’s not a murder mystery because we know who did it. We don’t know the “why” and “how” did it get to this point. What I also enjoyed is that Jen was able to observe her life when she went back. How often do we just react, but are not truly present in our lives?\\n\\nMy high score for this is because it was such a delightful surprise, being far more cerebral than I anticipated.',\n",

Following the clues all the way to the beginning, Jen hopes to figure out the puzzle and change her son’s future.\\n\\nThis is my third Gillian McAllister thriller and it did not disappoint! I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Lesley Sharp.

Progressing back in time to keep a crime from happening. To protect her son Todd and her marriage to Kelly. Along the way she picks up a piece here and a piece there. After consulting with a time travelling expert multiple times (he never remembers her), she resigns herself to jumping and combing for clues. This is a five-star concept, in my opinion, and I was thoroughly enjoying the story. Then this British author decided to insert some snide political comments about the 2020 US election. Sorry. Not sorry. There goes a star. That is just arrogant. I would not write a sci-fi thriller and insert extraneous comments about Brexit or the monarchy. It has happened before with other authors and I am tired of looking the other way.

       " 'Reviewed in the March 2023 edition of Quick Lit on Modern Mrs Darcy:\\n\\nThis was the best kind of brain bender! In the opening pages of this time-travel mystery, a British woman watches in horror from her window as her 18-year-old son stabs a man on the street. A horrific scene ensues, the police take him away, she spends the evening at the station, in shock and agony. But then Jen wakes up the next morning, only to find that it’s not the next morning at all, but the day before the crime occurred. When she wakes up the next morning, it’s the day before that. Jen seems to be living her life backward, and—with the help of a physicist friend-of-a-friend—determines that the only way to break out of the time loop is to “undo” whatever event put her son on the path to murder. To do that she has to go far, far back in time, getting to the roots of her most important relationships. This may end up on my best of the year list; it will certainly be one of my most enjoyable reading experiences.',\n",

       " 'It’s two o’clock in the morning and Jen Brotherhood is waiting for her eighteen year old son, Todd, to get home. Checking for him through the window, she’s momentarily relieved when she sees him round the corner…until she sees someone she doesn’t recognize approaching him. Suddenly, she’s watching her kind, thoughtful son pull a weapon and stab a stranger. Almost faster than her brain can process, Todd is handcuffed, put in a police car, and transported back to the station to await interrogation.\\n\\nAfter a heart-wrenching night, Jen awakens the next morning still in shock. But she has another blow coming, because it is yesterday and Todd is safe at home. The next morning, still trying to grapple with what is happening (is it a dream?), she is dismayed to find that it is now the day before yesterday. Instead of moving forward, Jen watches as her days slip backwards. Each day is the day before the last. Because somewhere in the past is the solution to the present. Jen just needs to uncover it. Can she stop her son from killing? And can she find a way out of the time loop she’s discovered herself in without disrupting the future?\\n\\nWow. Just wow. So full disclosure, this is the second time I started reading . The first time around I got about 100 pages in and put it down because I found it too slow and irritatingly repetitive. This time around (where I had, get this, déjà vu), after reading the long list of rave reviews, I pushed through and found myself horrified that I ever stopped in the first place.\\n\\nYes, I will admit the beginning is a slow grind full of repetitiveness in the vein of , but, once the basics are in place (I didn’t get to this point the first time around), the twists and turns are truly mind-blowing. McAllister crafted an entirely original storyline that weaves together two timelines and POVs, all ensconced in scientific suppositions that felt viable and logical. As we smoothly roll backwards in one timeline, the characters slowly morph into slightly altered versions of themselves, building genuine and realistic individuals who grew in depth along the way. I also found that, as the storyline advanced, even the scientific suppositions felt viable and logical. This built a cloak of believability to the plot, which could have easily swerved into territory that felt illogical or far-fetched. But with this book, I almost expected to wake up tomorrow morning to yesterday, able to fix the mistakes of my past.\\n\\nEven the shape of the plot line was superbly executed. Told in dual POVs and timelines, one methodically progressing backwards and the other unspooling forward at an initially unknown point in time, it could have become either strewn with unnecessary details or unbelievably confusing. Instead, it was well-crafted and finely tuned, weaving together an addictive tale about motherhood, second chances, and protecting those we love.\\n\\nOh, and the twists! Beginning about a third of the way in, each results in just enough of a shift to the storyline that I could no longer guess what was to come (and I definitely didn’t anticipate any of them). With the clues surreptitiously laced into the story, each reveal shattered my preconceived ideas and ratcheted up well-organized tension.\\n\\nI don’t know why, but I found this review incredibly hard to write (I’ve rewritten it several times). But with lies, secrets, and hidden motivations, I ended up mostly loving (apart from what I thought was a slow burn start) and left me wishing the epilogue was a full-blown sequel. On par with the works of Blake Crouch or Michael Crichton but with an emotional touch, this book was a overwhelmingly impressive work that, while keeping me in suspense, demonstrated the depth of a mother’s love (and which even made me cry). It left me not only shocked by the twists and turns, but questioning my own past and what I would change given the chance. A deep-thinking, mind-bending novel that will keep you riveted, don’t make the mistake that I did and put it down prematurely. Last but not least, make sure to read the acknowledgements! I always manage to forget them, but thankfully caught this one. Thank you, Ms. McAllister, for taking me on this wild ride… I strongly recommend taking the journey with her! Rating of 4.5 stars.\\n\\nTrigger warning: stabbing, death of a parent, brief mention of suicide',\n",

As she looks out her window, she sees him approaching but before she can feel fully relieved, she also sees an older man hurrying towards him. Jen and her husband Kelly anticipate what’s going to happen next but reach Todd too late. He’s brandished a knife and stabbed the stranger, killing him. Before the night is over, Todd’s in custody and his bright future looks bleak. Jen wakes the next morning fully resolved to bring whatever resources necessary to save her son but…he’s home. After a confusing conversation she learns that it’s the day before! Rather than spend too much time trying to figure out how it happened, Jen starts gathering information about her son’s life. When she wakes the next morning, it’s two days earlier and she continues going back in time each day.\\n\\n\\nI normally steer clear of time travel stories because the paradoxes give me brain cramps. But, this one was different. Each time Jen takes a leap backwards, she learns something new that might bring her closer to changing her son being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the beginning, it felt a little tedious but I came to love assembling the clues and making sense of them to form a narrative. Jen is highly skilled at figuring out what was to learn with each time shift primarily because she is so good at identifying nuances and has excellent recall of the past. It didn’t take very long for me to get immersed in this mystery, developing theories beyond Jen’s.\\n\\n\\nPart of the reason I got so fully absorbed in this story is because of the talented narrator. She was adept at handling voice distinctions, brought emotion and tension in her storytelling and moved the story along at what felt like a perfect pace. I loved her voice tone, too. It wasn’t until I was done that I learned she is one of my favorite actresses from the British series !\\n\\n\\nI loved this story and am thankful I went into it blind. There was little predictability, even the number of days leapt backwards. I never knew what was coming next and it took some time to formulate rational scenarios. There also came a time where I looked forward to the next leap, which is unusual for me. The ending made it all worthwhile as most of it was a surprise (I did figure out one of the mysteries, though) and loved that epilogue. What a fun ride through time to solve a gnarly mystery!\\n\\n\\n\\n(Thanks to HarperAudio for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)',\n",

A bit more complexity and depth to the mystery could have made this story even stronger, but it was entertaining and gripping regardless.\\n\\nThe one letdown of the book is the romance between Jen and her husband Kelly. The story is intertwined with anecdotes that retell Jen and Kelly's early days as a couple, and in those scenes their relationship bordered on instalove.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, this is a very fun and fast-paced read.

Didn’t really grab me, nothing really surprised me.\\n\\nI think I expected a lot due to the author's history as a crime podcast producer, and maybe I would have liked the book more had I not known her background. As it is, this is the story of journalist Margot, who returns to her small hometown in Indiana because her uncle who raised her is suffering from progressing dementia.

Margot sees connections and is determined to investigate. Are they really connected?\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\nI'm always a fan of cold case stories and those of missing people.

Too many similarities and possibly the writer pushing her agenda of what she thinks happened with that one.\\n\\nLike I said before, there really aren't any surprises, and if there are, there's not enough suspenseful tension built up to make the reader care about the identity of the villain(s).\\n\\nThe character development just isn't there with any of the characters. Although we get a past storyline and a present one, they aren't fleshed out very well to provide enough of a background to connect with anyone.\\n\\nAnd where I could forgive all of that and still say this was a halfway decent first book attempt, what I can't get past is the non-ending. You have Margot confronting someone and then...it just ends. I felt like something was left off, I actually turned back in my kindle to see if I accidentally skipped some pages, but no.

The family members are the most obvious suspects, but through multiple perspectives and time jumps, things get so much more convoluted and the single murder plot evolves into a dark web of intense small town secrets.\\n\\nI truly don’t understand if the author just ran out of time, or ink, or the publisher maybe forgot some pages at the end?

Flowers embraces this small twisted-town spirit and runs with it in this novel with a Jon Benet Ramsey-ish nod from the 90’s. Dead pageant-loving daughter, parents and brother survive, fingers pointed firmly at all of them at one time.

I listen to the audio version and could not wait each day I stopped to start it again.\\nIt is a small town mystery with sketchy characters rising out of the scene and I had my suspicions but quickly swept it under the rug with all their other secrets. It starts in 1994 when a six year old girl, January, goes missing. Her best friend lived across the street and carried with her the guilt that it could have been her.

And that’s not okay, especially in this genre.\\n\\nStory wise, it’s fun. Character wise, it’s meh. There was no character development, maybe Krissy a bit.

Then why not mention it?\\n\\nThe storyline was clearly inspired by real-life events of at least one real-life crime, that of JonBenét Patricia Ramsey. Maybe mixed in with Madeleine McCann and Caylee Anthony. I do not think it is far-fetched to assume that, taking into account who the author, Ashley Flowers is.\\nMy biggest problem is that this is basically a fictionalisation of a theory about a real-life child that has not only lost her life tragically but also been made into a media spectacle and now this book does even mention that?! How is that not disrespectful? I just cannot fathom the balls to do that. Can\\'t. Nope.\\nThis has clearly been inspired by and based on a real-life crime including a child (!), so we are not going to even mention that and basically create a theory about that and profit off of it and not even disclose it. Is this history repeating itself again? And is the \"author\" getting away with it again? Doesn\\'t sit right with me.\\n\\nI have a real problem with the lack of disclosure here, and skating on thin ice with ethics and morals as a human being.

The story primarily centers on Margot, who returns to the small town in which she grew up to take care of her uncle with dementia. She’s a journalist and takes an interest in a child abduction that looks similar to an unsolved murder of her best friend January when she was just 6 years old. You also get alternating chapters told from the POV of January’s mom, Kristy, from 1994 when the murder occurred. These w storylines converge in a really satisfying way.\\n\\nI liked Margot and Krissy and thought all of the characters were believable. While flawed, I could empathize which most of them. The mystery is sound, causing me to change my mind many times as to who the culprit might be.

That being said, I did enjoyed Margo's point of view as well as Chrissy. I also liked many twists in this story.

She meets The Golden Couple, Matthew and Marissa, who seem to have it all.\\n\\nFull disclosure: The reason that I was extremely interested in this book was that years ago I listened to an Audible Podcast by Esther Perel called, “Where Should We Begin?” Esther Perel is a psychoanalyst who taped her sessions with her clients. She must have picked her most fascinating cases because the series was highly addictive and changed my life. At the end of every day, I like to decompress with a book or a mindless episode of Netflix. For an hour, the world is a bit quieter, and I can breathe a little easier for a moment in time. In one episode, Esther Perel was talking about how some people are good at taking time to get in touch with themselves. Wait. So I’m not lazy or selfish but taking time to care for myself? It was exactly what I needed to hear. Perel also has a strong practice of counseling couples after infidelity. She mentioned something along the lines of that relationships should not be defined by exclusivity but uniqueness or quality. This was a lot to think about. Usually, society only talks about being faithful to one person but never really gets into the quality of the relationship. Also, if you have one quality relationship, should you be limited to just one relationship? And is it practical or even reasonable for one person to fulfill all of one person’s needs, wants, and desires? It was a lot of food for thought, and I really, really enjoyed noodling on these deep questions.\\n\\nMy expectations were admittedly sky-high picking up The Golden Couple. It wasn’t nearly as good as “Where Shall We Begin?” The Golden Couple seemed to drag a bit. There is a bit of a mystery or a puzzle at play, but I wasn’t surprised by the ultimate reveals. This book completely suspends reality, clues effortlessly fall into place. Avery is quite simply a joke. She is obsessed with her clients. She stalks them, and she doesn’t respect boundaries.\\n\\nOverall, this book was an average thriller that needed to up its storytelling.\\n\\n*Thanks NetGalley for providing this ARC (Advanced Reader Copy) at no charge in exchange for a fair and honest review.\\n\\n2023 Reading Schedule\\nJan Alice in Wonderland\\nFeb Notes from a Small Island\\nMar Cloud Atlas\\nApr On the Road\\nMay The Color Purple\\nJun Bleak House\\nJul Bridget Jones’s Diary\\nAug Anna Karenina\\nSep The Secret History\\nOct Brave New World\\nNov A Confederacy of Dunces\\nDec The Count of Monte Cristo',\n",

       " 'Thank you St. Martin\\'s Press and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book before publication.\\n\\nTHE PLOT\\n\\nQueen Clown (Avery) is an unconventional former therapist renowned for her wildly overpriced controversial 10-session method. Her newest patients, Mr & Mrs Clown (Matthew and Marissa) start seeing her hoping to solve their marriage problems. But will 10 sessions be enough for these clowns or is the truth beyond repair?\\n\\n\\n\\n*Sighs* *Removes glasses* *Stretches fingers* Are you guys ready?\\n\\nI\\'m actually so overwhelmed by the sheer amount of audacity and dumbassery these characters displayed, I don\\'t know where to start.\\n\\n1. This is my third book from this duo. I came into this 1/2. I was pleasantly surprised by The Anonymous Girl and detested The Wife Between Us. Welp. The Golden Couple can go straight in the bin with TWBU. What a hot mess. Whatever ghost writer they used for The Anonymous Girl—go back to them. They were decent.\\n\\n2. Now. Let me tell you about this abysmal writing quality. In fact, let me show you some examples so you can see (my opinion) the difference between beautiful writing and basic writing. Beautiful writing provokes emotions, makes you think about things in a different way. Basic writing tells you what\\'s happening as if you\\'re blind: \"She\\'s going into the kitchen. She opens a cupboard. She grabs a bowl.\" BASIQUEEEEE\\n\\nHere\\'s an excerpt from a recent novel I loved, After We Were Stolen: \"Sunlight stretched like fingers through the glass, but they weren\\'t long enough to touch us.\" You see how creative and beautifully the author described something as mundane as sun shining through a window?\\n\\nAnd here\\'s some basic bish boo boo from The Golden Couple: \"I\\'m waring glasses with nonprescription lenses and cherry-red frames, which I also purchased at the drugstore.\" ????????????? Literally giving closed captions vibes (nothing wrong with that—but I\\'m not blind)\\n\\n3. Each character was a special kind of stupid. Avery is an unprofessional \"consultant\" who lost her license for being a stalker. Her 10 sessions are basically staking out her clients and forcing them down a path whether they like it or not. Beyond her lack of professionalism, she is happy her harmless husband (20 yrs older than her) dies because he can\\'t give her enough attention (not abusive, just into his work) and she puts her rescue dog in a crate as soon as she brings him home AND locks him in the car so she can overstep some boundaries. Cool.\\n\\nMr & Mrs Clown are... well, boring and pathetic. I can\\'t get into their relationship without giving too much away, but Marissa is the classic PTA mom fueled by white wine and xanax, and her husband is a blonde white guy who makes a lot of money doing god knows what. Yawn. I find this writing duo LOVES the Boston white rich couple trope... I don\\'t think I\\'ve encountered any POC characters in their books.\\n\\nSkip (Avery\\'s one night stand and Mr & Mrs Clown\\'s childhood friend) is pathetic. He, like most of these characters, is stuck in the past, mulling over teenage love. Normal stuff. Side note: The way the authors described the \"class differences\" between the \"summer guests\" and the actual little town people is HILARIOUS. Ladies, this is not 1930s. It really isn\\'t controversial for people with parents from different backgrounds to date anymore. Sorry.\\n\\n4. The only reason I didn\\'t give this 1 star is because for some sick reason, I had to know what happened. And I was kinda surprised, but the motive was EXTRA and each character showed their ass in their own special way. Also, the authors wrapped it up like bloop casual murder, no investigation, life continues on.\\n\\n5. There were so many ???? moments... like Avery being threatened in an underground parking lot, contemplating calling the police and then concluding \"what can they arrest him for? Being in a parking garage with me?\" Ummm?? He literally threatened you??????? And then when Marissa found out her creepy ass assistant was lying to her... she was still like, NBD just come back to work and give me any flimsy ass excuse because I\\'m naive and gullible!!! And lastly... when Avery convinces her much younger boy toy to threaten a client\\'s ex-wife.... LOL???? And then he asks to make it official and Avery\\'s like can\\'t you see I was using you for your abs and your willingness to perform illegal tasks while wearing an identifiable work uniform??? Like how in tf could you convince a normal person to do this. What did he have to gain!? There was no sense beyond this except it\\'s a fiction book, so the authors feel like they can write whatever they want whether the math is mathin or not.\\n\\n\\nPros: The ending kinda surprised me. I fell into the obvious suspect trap until it was too late.\\nCons: Everything else. Bye.',\n",

       " 'What an engrossing, dramatic story!\\n\\n\\n\\nMarissa and Mathew Bishop are a DC/Maryland \"Golden Couple\" - both are good looking, popular, and successful in their individual careers. Their marriage looks almost too ideal...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut something is horribly, terribly wrong...\\nMarissa Bishop is desperate to repair her fractured marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarissa hires the infamous couples counselor, Avery Chambers, hoping that her \"Ten Step program\" is going to salvage her imploding marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t go into many details without dropping a \"brick-ton\" of spoilers, so you will have to read the book or listen to the excellent audiobook to find out for yourself whether Avery succeeds in putting this Golden Couple back on their social throne. (I found the unorthodox therapies and analysis riveting stuff. Psychology and psychoanalysis have always been my kryptonite!)\\n\\n\\n\\nDid I figure out all of the mysteries, secrets and lies? You bet, and I suspect that you will, too! Even before I started listening to the audiobook (and reading the Ebook at my gym) I had a suspicion of where this story would go. The side plot involving Avery and the nasty pharmaceutical company held a few unexpected twists and turns, but for the most part, there weren\\'t any glaring shockers that you couldn\\'t see coming.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolly - Marissa\\'s assistant at her high end boutique - was so annoying, and Natalie - Mat\\'s ex-college girlfriend - was still in the picture, as was Marissa\\'s \"first kiss\" childhood sweetheart, Skip.\\nIs that a love-triangle... or two... or three... that the authors have inserted in this busy plot?\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while there I couldn\\'t tell if Natalie was there merely to establish a love triangle, or whether she was something more sinister.....! (One small pet peeve of mine: I actually dislike when villains become \"nice people after all\" at the end of a story, despite their many misdeeds.)\\n\\nIf you are a Hendricks and Pekkanen fan, then you already know that they don\\'t usually do HEA\\'s - but you do get a twinge of hope for a future HEA in this story - surprise, surprise!.... Well, not really. You could probably see that coming too....\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the writing was generally very good, the plot got a bit muddled towards the last third of the novel. In fact, it took an abrupt about-face, character-wise, which is something that can rarely be carried off well. Sorry to say, it didn\\'t transition well for me here either. For me, the authors sort of bludgeoned you over the head with clues and over-explained things right from the very start. (Marissa\\'s demeanour during the first counseling session gave the whole show away right then and there.)\\n\\n\\n\\nThis story started off strongly, and despite the weaker third portion, I was totally invested in finding out how the story would end - and whether my preliminary suspicions were correct. (I wasn\\'t too far off the mark. Maybe I\\'ve been reading too many thrillers?)\\n\\nI\\'m rating this one a 3.8, rounded up to a 4, out of 5 because the writing in the e-book was very good (if a tad over-explained here and there). I was given ARCs for both the e-book and the audiobook of by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen. Karissa Vacker and Marin Ireland did a fabulous job of dramatizing this dark domestic thriller. My thanks to the authors, their publisher and NetGalley for ARCs of this e-book and audiobook in exchange for an honest review.

       " '***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY***\\n\\n“THE GOLDEN COUPLE”, we all know at least one. They seem to have it all, looks, a loving marriage, a beautiful home, etc etc. Look too closely though and that gold may just be the shiny finish which hides the tarnish below it!!\\n\\nMarissa and Matthew Bishop are attending the first of 10 sessions by a therapist. Avery has had her license revoked for crossing boundaries, but that hasn’t stopped her from attracting clients. In fact her approach seems to work for some couples and word has spread about her program. She claims that she can help you resolve your problems with just ten sessions. She is also very selective in who she chooses to treat.\\n\\nMarissa was given her name by a friend and has talked her husband into attending the first session. She has a secret that she needs to tell him and she needs an outlet for revealing it, Avery’s first session seemed the perfect time. Marissa has been unfaithful and this has been looming over her like a dark cloud, ready to explode!!\\n\\nThe couple has one child, Bennett aged 8 whom they cherish. Matthew is a workaholic and doesn’t really spend much time with Bennett. The day to day care of the house and Bennett are left up to Marissa. Marissa has a shop in the city that keeps her busy during the hours when she is not at home. She has a unique style and her shop has done very well, enough that she has hired an assistant, Polly, who works hours when Marissa can’t be there.\\n\\nThere are a lot of ancillary characters in this book, a few of which I felt weren’t really necessary to the plot. Perhaps the author chose to add them to add to the readers confusion as to who was really doing what in this novel.\\n\\nAs you probably can suspect, Marissa’s one lie points to a lot more than one problem in their marriage.\\n\\nThe first half of this book was a bit slow but the pace quickly picked up in the second half and I flew through the pages. I did not guess the multitude of twists in this novel and the final reveal was a good one which will be a shocker for many!!\\n\\nI think this is a good domestic thriller and can recommend it to those who enjoy a strongly character driven novel.\\n\\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss.\\n\\nThe Golden Couple will be published in March of 2022.',\n",

I am sure I will see a five-star book by these authors soon in the future when they will get a perfect story suiting their writing style.\\n\\nThis book is not different from their previous books. Their writing style will keep us hooked on the plot. The authors tell us the story of Marissa and Matthew Bishop. They seem to have everything that a couple would love to have in their life. The life of this perfect couple gets deeply affected when Marissa falls into an affair. They decide to visit Avery, a therapist, to get professional help to solve this problem.\\n\\nAvery is an interesting character with a tumultuous history. She lost her professional license to practice due to her maverick, unethical ways of treating patients.

I remember reading an article where Will Moss said that\\n\\n\\nWhen we are in love, we usually ignore certain behaviors and actions (including a few red flags) of our lover. We would have reacted to those actions if they had been done by anyone other than our lover.

With the advent of social media, Instagram reels, tik tok videos, and youtube are all influencing our lives to a great extent. It is social media that decide even what we should read. The BookTok and bookstagram sections of bookstores are becoming bigger nowadays. In one way, it is good to see people using social media in the best way possible to promote reading. But it has a few negative aspects that need some more profound discussion. Similarly, the impact of social media on relationships is enormous, and this book beautifully describes this aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is nothing new in this plot. We have read many thrillers with similar stories, and the twists can be easily predicted if you are a person who is familiar with the world of thrillers. The way Avery’s character is crafted and her concept of ethics and ten session clients might irritate many readers.\\n\\nIt is still remarkable how the authors compensated for these negatives with the alternating perspectives of the characters and their amazing writing skills.\\n\\n\\nThis will be a good choice if you have loved the previous books by the same authors or if you love to read a propulsive thriller.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\n| | | | | | |',\n",

Can Avery suss out the suspects AND put this crumbling marriage back together? Or has entangling herself with this power couple taken her down a dangerous road...with a deadly end?\\n\\nI had VERY strong feelings about The Wife Between Us, and they were not positive feelings. I remember almost tossing my e-reader in frustration at the time because things were so OTT in that book, at least for me, and I was pretty sure they weren\\'t the writers for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of my main problems with the last read were that I could a) guess almost everything that was going to happen b) couldn\\'t stand the characters and c) thought some of the character\\'s actions were downright silly.\\n\\nIn this one however, Hendricks and Pekkanen kept me glued to my seat! I honestly kept thinking about this book every time I had to put it down, was swept into the mystery, and fully engrossed in the characters. Both Avery and Marissa\\'s POVs were equally interesting (in different ways) and was obscured throughout the book to keep you just a little bit puzzled and wanting more. In so many thrillers, I think authors try to drop many breadcrumbs, perhaps so their readers can feel like they are clever by figuring everything out ahead of time.\\n\\nBut honestly? There\\'s almost nothing I hate when reading a thriller than figuring out everything ahead of time...so this was a PERFECT read for me!\\n\\nThere was also a perfect balance between the past and present, as well as between both story lines and how well they intertwined...not sure if this was due to the joint writing effort from two authors, but it just worked. I also loved that even though Marissa and Matthew were supposed to be sort of a \\'posh\\' couple, in many ways they felt down to earth and accessible and there was emotion tied in when the authors detailed their marital strife. I love when a thriller can also tug at my heart strings a bit, and this one certainly did!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe winners are Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen! 👏\\n\\n4.5 ⭐️',\n",
       " 'The only thing Avery Bishop and the word \"average\" have in common is their first three letters. She is anything but your average therapist; in fact, \"unorthodox\" is a far better term to describe her, and her newest clients Marissa and Matthew Bishop are about to discover how far outside the box Avery is willing to go to help their marriage after Marissa confesses that she slept with another man. There\\'s a reason Avery isn\\'t licensed anymore, but her new freedom certainly lets her be more ... ummmm ... creative in her approach!\\n\\nThis is my first book by the duo Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen and I wasn\\'t disappointed. I read it on my Kindle while also listening to the audiobook, wonderfully narrated by one of my faves, Marin Ireland, and Karissa Vacker, both of whom brought the characters to life perfectly - even the Bishops\\' young son Bennett, which can sometimes be tricky for narrators to do authentically.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to deep dive into the book, since plenty of reviews have done that already, but if you enjoy a book that keeps you guessing until the end and where you suspect nearly EVERY character at some point, you\\'ll enjoy this one. It\\'s not full-on thriller, but more simmering suspense and mystery, and I thought the authors did a stellar job with misdirection. My only complaint might be that, while I loved the final reveal, some aspects of the ending afterward wrapped up a little too neatly and easily, but nothing that took away from my enjoyment.\\n\\nI\\'ll say this: Avery may not play by the book, but I\\'m glad she\\'s the star of this one. She\\'s a fun character, and I hope I\\'ll be seeing her again!\\n\\n★★★★\\n\\nThanks to St. Martin\\'s Press, NetGalley, and authors Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen for this ARC.

       " \"Talk about the art of slow escalation!\\n\\nFrom the moment the characters were introduced, I was intrigued and wanted to know more about them, especially Avery. She was the therapist helping other people with their problems, but it was pretty clear that she had many problems of her own. Saying she “helps” people with her problems is definitely an understatement because my girl here takes her job really inappropriately seriously. I really enjoyed her character. There were many characters that kept coming up in the book, including the main ones, Marissa and Mathew, and Hendricks and Pekkanen were great at literally making everyone a suspect.\\n\\nThe only problem I had with this was how weirdly predictable some of this was. The connections we get at the end weren’t obvious to me, but I found the events to be the predictable part. It wasn't predictable immediately because the story does shift into way different issues than what most of us would expect when first starting. It felt like we just kept getting a lot of information, but I saw how it was all part of Hendricks and Pekkanen's sick plan to keep me hooked, and I was pretty satisfied.\",\n",
       " '3.5 stars: If you’re looking for a page-turning suspense story, “The Golden Couple” will satiate that need. The Hendricks/Pekkanen duo has written another solid thriller after their “The Wife Between Us” achievement.\\n\\nIt’s a character-driven story, with two POVs. Avery Chambers is an unorthodox therapist who recently lost her professional license after being reported to the governing ethics committee for using unsanctioned methods. Nonetheless, she has excellent results and thereby many clients. She begins the story, introducing the reader to Marissa Bishop. Marissa has hired her because she is fearing the state of her marriage, after cheating on her husband, Matthew. Marissa and Matthew are known as the golden couple in that they appear to be perfect in every way. Perfection is always fodder for a great story.\\n\\nAvery promises a “quick” fix in ten sessions. Again, her methods are unorthodox which is also fodder for an engrossing story. Through Avery’s chapters we learn of her methods, of her other clients, of her personal life. Marissa’s chapters provide the reader with the Chamber’s marriage, although we never learn Matthew’s side in the ten-step process. Immediately it appears there are a lot of secrets, much information is withheld from the reader’s view. The chapters are short, and just when one secret is revealed, the other woman’s chapter begins. There’s much misdirection, leaving the reader’s head spinning. Somehow, it appears that some particulars in Avery’s life are merging with the Chamber’s marital issues.\\n\\nWhile Avery attempts to find out who is causing her personal pain, the Chamber’s marriage seems more fraught with other issues than infidelity.\\n\\nFor me, a good thriller is one that keeps me interested and guessing. This one did it. It’s a solid read.',\n",
       " 'The Golden Couple is a compelling psychological thriller and one of the better ones I’ve read in a while.\\n\\nAvery Chambers has an unorthodox method of therapy that she uses to treat her clients. It’s so unethical that she lost her license several months ago. Despite this, her therapy sessions have proven effective, and many clients still seek her out.\\n\\nMeet Marissa. Marissa recently cheated on her husband Matthew, something that she deeply regrets. Marissa earnestly hopes that Avery can help repair their relationship.\\n\\nAvery always tries to find the actual crux of the problem, not the one that is merely on the surface. She believes the situation may be murkier than the pretty picture this golden couple presents.\\n\\nThe Golden Couple alternates POVs between Avery and Marissa. Many chapters end with little cliffhangers that make this a very captivating read. The carefully crafted reveals had me flipping the pages as fast as I could. Just when I thought I had it figured out, bam, there was another twist that made me reconsider everything.\\n\\nThe authors did a great job writing multi-dimensional characters. Avery and Marissa are wholly complex and dynamic characters; they aren’t the typical hysterical, unreliable female narrators that are so common these days. I thought Avery would be insufferable, the pretentious and spoof therapist, but she ended up being my favourite character.\\n\\nMy one complaint would be that everything wrapped up very quickly.\\n\\nI hope this author duo keeps writing together because I will keep reading whatever they cook up.\\n\\nI highly recommend this well-plotted and suspenseful thriller.\\n\\nThank you to St. Martin’s Press for an arc provided via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.',\n",

In this case, the theft of a historical violin, is at the center of this multi-layered ‘whodunit’.\\n\\nAs a veteran mystery reader, I did guess early-on who was behind the theft. Despite that, the particulars are well hidden, and worth sticking around for. But in my opinion, this book is far more than just a standard mystery/thriller.\\n\\nIt’s an eye-opening story, giving the reader a look at the classical music world, which can be an adversarial environment, especially when it comes to competitions.

       " '“The Violin Conspiracy” is a story that has staying power. This is so much more than just a thriller. This is multi-dimensional story that involves the life of a classical violinist, a family drama, an historical fiction nod to the horrors of slavery, a coming-of-age story, and a story of greed. But mostly, it’s a story about sticking with what you love, even if people tell you that what you love is not something you should do because it doesn’t fit with what they expect of you.\\n\\nRayquan (Ray) McMillian is a black young adult attempting to make it as a classical violinist. Problem: There are no black classical violinist. Even his own family refers to it as “messing with the fiddle”. His mom tells him to get a REAL job, at Popeyes, and help support the family and stop this silly business with the fiddle. Ray confronts a lot of racism with his violin. Many times I had to stop reading, I was so upset. But what upset me most was the lack of family support. Author Brendan Slocumb channeled some real-life experiences into his novel. I sure hope he had better family support than Rayquan did!\\n\\nRay has always loved playing his violin. He rented his violin from his school, always needing to return it at the end of the year. And, as with all school rented musical instruments, it was not a highly functional violin. Although his mother discouraged his playing, his grandmother loved it when he played his fiddle. She happened to save her husband’s violin, Ray’s Grandfather, and gave it to Ray. It was in no condition for play. Yet Ray sees the violins worth in that it was one that was handed down in generations, played by Ray’s ancestors.\\n\\nLong story short, he gets it cleaned up (and his experience at the violin establishment was enough to make me pause) and lands a full scholarship to college. Shortly after that, he learns that he possesses a rare violin. Suddenly his family wants a piece of the action. It’s akin to a story of a person who wins the lottery and family suddenly comes out of the woodwork.\\n\\nOh but there’s more. Once the violin’s worth becomes public knowledge, then the slave owners of his Great-great-great-great grandfather say it’s their violin and they want it back. Ray’s Grandmother always said that the violin was given to the great-great-great-great-grandfather by his slave owner (who was thought to be the paternal father of Ray’s grandfather). Now they want the violin.\\n\\nAs the story opens, the violin is stolen (hence the conspiracy). Who took it? Where is it? The list of suspects is long. Meanwhile Ray is in a highly rated competition in Moscow and he needs his violin back. The person(s) who stole the violin are holding it for a ransom.\\n\\nThis is the bones of the story. The meat is Ray’s life as a violinist. What it takes to be a superior violinist; the money involved in pursuit of being a classical violinist is astounding. What he needs to overcome because he’s not white; no one expects a Black man to be able to play concert violin solos. The racism is difficult to read. Sadly, in the author’s notes, Slocumb said these things have happened to him. There are details of concert life that are very interesting.\\n\\nI chose to listen to the audio production of this story. The narrator, JD Jackson did not grab me right away. However, at the end, I feel he was the correct voice choice. Violin music plays between major chapters. I enjoyed the music, as it put me in the “feel” of the story. At the end, Mr. Slocumb narrates his author notes which are insightful. I highly recommend the audio. This is a story MADE for audio!',\n",
       " \"I was given an Advanced Reader Copy from Netgalley and the publishers in exchange for an Honest Review.\\n\\nI give this 2.5 stars going down to 2 stars for the purpose of this rating system.\\n\\nThis novel has a lot of interesting elements to it. It follows a young black man who is an underdog in every way as he attempts to rise to the top of his field. He struggles with low self worth, an unsupportive money hungry family, and multiple other issues. It should have made for an interesting read.\\n\\nI just don't think the execution was great. It is a coming to age with a little bit of mystery. The blurb suggests that we will be following the story of Ray McMillian trying to get his violin after it is stolen for ransom. That is how it starts however it quickly switches to 7 years ago (the start of his journey of becoming a professional musician) and it slowly works it self back to the present.\\n\\nThis takes a up a good portion of the book.I think some backstory was needed and helped me understand the main character and his family more. The issue came in that because it went on for so long it became very repetitive and I started to lose interest. Each chapter we would have Ray go up in age and deal with the same racial abuse from different people. It was never ending. It slowed down the pace of the book tremendously. Which is time that could have went towards building a mystery.\\n\\nI read the author's note and I understand that he had to put up with a lot of the unfortunate racist attacks just because he is a black boy/man trying to play violin. As a black woman I can certainly empathize with the author. However, I think it would have been better if he had written a non fiction novel so that people could properly bare witness to all he had to endure. Because putting in so many examples of racism into THIS book did not add to the story. It only served to neglect other elements.\\n\\nEven when we got back to the present the book seemed to be going nowhere.\\n\\nI was able to read this book quickly but I did not enjoy it.\",\n",

He has been using his great-grandfather\\'s \"fiddle\" for many years. The violin is a Stradivarius and worth a lot of money and is very precious to him. It is stolen from his hotel room on the eve of an important Classical Music Competition. I thought there would be more of a mystery on the quest to find who stole it. The story then goes into Ray\\'s background and how he started out playing the violin. His family especially his mother has never been supportive but his Grandmother always was. She is the one who gives Ray her Father\\'s old fiddle which has been in her attic for many years collecting dust. Once it\\'s found out just how much it\\'s worth his family turns on him.

Dawn came, light glistening off a frozen pond.\"\\n\\nRay McMillian painted all this for them through the melody that permeated through the air. His talent streamed within the strings and the light touches of the bow of PopPop\\'s ancient violin. The music carried itself from his very bones and from the hidden chambers of his mind. He was born to play.\\n\\nBrendan Slocumb creates an experience for all of us through The Violin Conspiracy. He broadens his scope to reach out to all who have been dismissed and diminished in society. This novel speaks out against those who view others with a tainted lens that dims the dreams and hopes of far too many based on race, gender, social status, perceived intelligence, and wrongful stereotyping. Ray\\'s story will shine a light upon those darkened corners.\\n\\nRay\\'s grandmother, Nora, is one of those light bearers. Ray has always shown an interest in the violin and has been relegated to his school violin on loan. But his grandmother gifts him with possession of his great-great-grandfather\\'s violin. Slocomb will take us back on a journey of the origins of this instrument and why it is so precious in the eyes of Ray and his grandmother. It is through the strength of those vibes that Ray becomes better and better. He astounds his teachers even without the enhancement of private lessons.\\n\\nBut things at home take on a different slant. His mother is demanding in her nature and she expects Ray to quit school and work at the local Popeye\\'s to bring in money to help raise his twin sisters. She shuts him down at every opportunity and throws his vision of a musical career to the wayside. Ray will remember his grandmother\\'s words and he bends over backwards to compensate his family with odd jobs while keeping focused on his dream. Lack of support from our own is the sharpest arrow to the heart.\\n\\nThe Violin Conspiracy will pivot back and forth to the present where Ray\\'s precious violin has been stolen from his hotel room. He\\'s soon to leave to Moscow for the Tchaikovsky Competition. Ray is absolutely distraught. We will come to find that this old violin in the cracked alligator case is worth far more than anyone ever expected.

       " 'Decent Plot, Complex Characters, Slow Pacing\\n\\nIn the opening scene, Ray has his extremely expensive Stradivarius violin stolen. Then, we relive Ray’s background, his musical journey, his family, and all of the suspects. Who did it?\\n\\nThe Violin Conspiracy has an interesting plot, weaving in important social justice issues, and some of the characters have an engaging backstory. Despite getting a “golden ticket”, it isn’t all smooth sailing for Ray.\\n\\nThis book did touch on some issues close to home. In the book, Ray talked about his lack of private lessons, and I could completely relate. When I was in the sixth grade, I began to play the flute for the first time as part of the school band. I loved music, diligently practiced on a daily basis, even slept with my sheet music under my pillow.\\n\\nI don’t know if things have changed since then, but the teacher would rank each student publicly. First chair would be the best student, and the worst would be last chair. What a great way to shame students publicly!\\n\\nMy fellow students had taken private lessons since kindergarten. Some of them owned extremely expensive flutes (while I had the school rental just like Ray) and attended $1,000+ per week music camps. Despite my enthusiasm for music, I was consistently ranked last chair and dropped out after two years.\\n\\nMusic education is in definite need of an overhaul….but I digress.\\n\\nThe pacing in The Violin Conspiracy is too slow. It seemed to drag on and on. Ray did too many practices and recitals. Although I do understand that that is what musicians do, it wasn’t particularly interesting and didn’t make for great storytelling with the level of repetition.\\n\\nFurther, I wasn’t a big fan of the ending. The person who “did it” never made much sense from the beginning.',\n",
       " 'I enjoyed reading this book and rate it 4 stars. It is more of a story of the world of classical musicians than a mystery.

Ray\\'s violin is stolen and the thief wants $5 million.\\nThe mystery of who stole the violin is solved.\\nMore enlightening is the reality of the all too real racism present in the classical music world.

I don’t know about you guys, but in the world of classical music, I know little to nothing. However, Slocumb with this book reminds me that racism can exist in a lot of places even in the places we don’t think about.\\n\\nWho knew a story about a black man and his love for playing the violin could unfold a story of family history, determination, family dynamics, and of course, racism, both overt and covert. I enjoyed being on this journey with Ray, and knowing that much of this is inspired by Slocumb’s life makes me connect to it more. I love that I could feel Ray’s passion every time he spoke about his dreams as a violinist, and it broke my heart that it’s through his dreams that he discovers how far racism goes.\\n\\nAlthough this book is also advertised as a thriller, I really felt that it could get away with not describing it as such because those parts were pretty predictable. Luckily, the story is more focused on Ray, and his journey which more than made up for this. And although this story deals with hard subjects, it didn’t feel like a book full of riddles and complicated literary devices but a story that anyone can read and understand.\\n\\nI would absolutely recommend it!',\n",
       " '[3+] My favorite part of this book is the afterword where the author discusses the racism he encountered as a Black classical musician and how it motivated him to write. I did find the novel easy to focus on during a distracting time. I wished for more depth and ambiguity - the characters were mostly extremely greedy or virulently racist with just a few exceptions. And the plot was simplistic. The best parts of the novel were the vivid descriptions of Ray playing the violin.',\n",
       " \"3.5 stars\\n\\nRay McMillan is an extremely talented violinist. He is a black young man, using a school rented violin to play. He is poor but has a talent that no one can take from him. His family, particularly his mother are not nice people. His mother wants him to go and get a job preferably at Popeye's, so he could earn money which her greedy self feels she needs. However, Ray is the apple of his grandmother's eye and when she hears him play, she is reminded of Pop Pop. She tells Ray that Pop Pop had inherited an old violin from his ancestors who were slaves. It was given to his great great great grandfather from the owner of the plantation where he was a slave. There is a chance that the violin is upstairs in the grandmother's attic and after much searching, Ray finds it. It's old dilapidated and needs work and is encased in an old alligator skin case. Ray is thrilled to finally have a violin of his very own.\\n\\nAs the story continues Ray and his family find out that this is not any ordinary violin but the prized and worth a fortune Stradivarius. His family is beside themselves claiming the violin belongs to the family with their hands constantly out for money. Of course, Ray is beside himself carrying the violin with him at all times, and attracting the attention of some who recognized his extraordinary playing, while also encountering the current family of the man who originally gave Ray's ancestor the instrument. Of course they say his great great great grandfather had taken it.\\n\\nLawsuits ensue and as Ray climbs up the ladder and his skills are recognized more and more; he enters the prestigious Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. Much to his chagrin, the Stradivarius is stolen, and Ray and his girlfriend are determined to pay the ransom and get what belongs to Ray back. It's a harrowing time, fighting off his greedy relatives and also the sister brother team who want their instrument returned, while preparing for the most intense performance Ray will ever have.\\n\\nI appreciated that this story shone a light on someone who is gifted in music, someone whose life is music, someone who had a bleak future ahead, finding courage and determination and growing into a decent man. Yes, Ray faced prejudices and the author made that quite apparent in the telling, but Ray was no quitter and he sallied forth with the sage advice of his grandmother. The story was interesting and made many valid points about discrimination against the black community in the area of classical music which hopefully have diminished.\",\n",
       " 'A great concept and well structured, hence my 3 stars, but unfortunately I did not like the writing.\\nThe characters felt too weak and cartoonish.

I also thought that it was too repetitive.\\nThe racism was showcased throughout the entire book, but because of the writing I couldn’t feel a thing and the mystery element was very disappointing.\\nI really wanted to love this book, as my friends did.',\n",
       " \"Really enjoyed this debut novel from Brendan Slocumb which centers around a Black man who has a passion for classical music and a Stradivarius violin that has been stored in his grandmothers attic for decades, with the twists being that nobody knew it was a Stradivarius, as well as some family intrigue from the days when his great-great-grandfather was a slave. Ray, our protagonist, catches the eye of a college professor who gets him the training he needs, but this violin takes him to a new level. Lots going on in this book as Ray's family fights him for ownership of the violin, and the descendants of the slave owner also want the violin returned to them. On top of this the violin is stolen (which in and of itself is just a super part of the book), and we see the racism that is in classical music, as well as Ray's own mother continuing to denigrate his music and efforts. While the author makes the case for racism in classical music, to me an even stronger criticism has to go to Ray's family who refuse to support or encourage classical music. Very good book on so many levels.\",\n",

And this is what we want to follow – not just the importance of the fiddle, but the impact on Ray’s life and the choices he makes for the love of music and playing the violin.\\n\\nBut, don’t just stop with the end of the story.

No matter how nice the suit, no matter how educated his speech or how strong the handshake, no matter how much muscle he packed on, no matter how friendly or how smart he was, none of it mattered at all. He was just a Black person. That’s all they saw and that’s all he was.”\\n\\n\\nWhile I did find to be a bit all over the place the author's acknowledgements hit hard. The book opens in medias res with Ray McMillian, our main character, discovering that his Stradivarius has been stolen. Ray is preparing for the international Tchaikovsky Competition and without his fiddle, he feels unmoored. The narrative then jumps back in time where we meet Ray in his teens and learn more about his family situation. His mother wants him to drop school so he can work full time and so she can buy a new tv. When Ray begins to earn good money by playing at various events she quietens down somewhat but she still clearly disapproves of his violin playing and often ridicules him and his belief that he could pursue a career as a violinist. The only supportive member of his family is Ray’s beloved grandmother who loves him to bits. She also wants him to play and gifts him her grandpa’s fiddle. Ray eventually ends up getting a scholarship for a prestigious college. His mother doesn’t want him to go but Ray is determined to follow his path. He eventually learns that his violin is a Stradivarius. His family wants him to sell it and claim that it was never his, to begin with. To keep them at bay Ray begins to send them large sums of money but they never seem satisfied. He also begins to receive thinly threatening letters from a family that claims to be the righteous owners of the violin, and it turns out that they are descendants of the people who had once enslaved Ray’s great-grandfather. Eventually, the narrative reaches the beginning, where Ray’s beloved violin has been stolen and the competition is just around the corner.\\nThroughout the narrative, the author highlights just how racist and elitist the classical music world is. From when he played as a teenager at venues to his time as a teacher and a professional violinist, Ray experiences racism. Classical music is something that is often associated with whiteness and because of this Ray has to fight to be accepted into this world. No matter how hard he proves himself he will be confronted with people dismissing his skills, claiming that he is a ‘diversity token’ or diminishing his talent. There are many harrowing scenes where Ray is mistreated and abused, and the realism of these scenes made it clear that these episodes had likely been experienced by the author himself (such as the wedding one early on). From outright racist remarks to more ‘veiled’ ones, Ray has to fight tooth and nail to claim a space in this extremely white elitist world. That he has no support from his family certainly doesn’t help as with the exception of his grandmother and an aunt, they are all keen on him selling his violin.\\nThe novel tries to combine a Bildungsroman novel with a more suspenseful storyline but the two don't quite mesh together. The flashbacks into Ray’s teenage years do add context to his life and the violin but they fail to make him into a more rounded character. I found him rather flat, at times a little more than a vehicle to move the story forward. I would have liked for him to have a more defined personality and a more developed characterisation. Other characters were similarly one-dimensional, Ray’s mother in particular. She’s portrayed as a horrible person: every scene she is in she says something awful. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and I could not understand why Ray would bother with her at all. He also has siblings but we never see him interact with them. His other relatives, with the exception of that one aunt, are all greedy and nasty to him. The bad characters in this book are also extremely one-note. This is fair enough, a simplistic approach could have worked but I found it annoying that the author would describe these characters as physically ‘ugly’ and are often ‘fat’. The woman who claims that the violin belongs to her family for instance has ‘jowls’ covered by ‘downy hair’. All of the policemen are of the doughnut-eating variety, but this, I didn’t mind as much given my less than warm feelings towards them.\\nAnyway, the story suggests that either Ray’s family or this white family are behind his missing violin. The novel then takes a weird turn by making someone else responsible and forgetting almost entirely of Ray’s family or that other one. It just seemed an odd choice and a predictable one at that.\\nI also did not care for the way Ray spoke about or describes women (“the tawny-haired woman with the tight dress running her fingers suggestively around her wineglass”; “The attractive women who seemed to take an interest in him were mostly in the look-but-don’t-touch category”; “A young athletic woman was crossing in front of them, her toned ass bouncing with every step in her black leggings.”).\\nThe writing too could be quite cheesy, especially in its efforts to tie everything back to classical music (“He tried to breathe but his ribs had been wrapped in piano wire”; “Why was he so terrible at talking to this woman? She was violin-shaped, right? So why was this so hard?”).\\nStill, while I wasn’t a huge fan of the writing or the characters, the story was relatively engaging. If you are interested in this novel I recommend that you check it out yourself.\",\n",

As soon as it became possible, Ray was pressured to stop wasting time with his stupid fiddling and get a shelf-stockin\\' job to \"help the family\" (aka his selfish mother). Time to make horrible noises on his fiddle was more than merely grudged, it was a source of actual anger...seen as selfish, unproductive, the action of a loser.

You were right, there is.\\n\\nAnd a more wonderful soul it\\'s hard to conjure. I was all ready to Pearl-Rule this bad boy before Grandma Nora (she whose belief in Ray makes her \"talk so sweet {about him} it could give you diabetes\") came on stage, I was so pissed off at the Philistines and money-grubbers Ray has to call family! What malign genetic flub gave Grandma Nora a daughter like Ray\\'s mom?! And there\\'s no end to the nasty, of course, since this is a thriller/mystery. But that\\'s the tour I signed up to take, and was ready for. A bracing dose of lovingkindness later, it was all gas no brakes and that finish line won\\'t know what hit it.\\n\\nRay, as you\\'ll have gathered, is a fine musician and to hell with his grasping, whiny mother complaining about the \"racket\" his practicing makes. He perseveres, Grandma Nora\\'s staunchness in his corner, and actually begins to climb the ladder of classical violin\\'s performance hierarchy. What he faces along the way is no surprise to anyone reasonably sentient, as his ethnicity is used by everyone around him. Only rarely to help him, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be stunned to learn. His other shining light is his teacher, his one professional mentor, Dr, Janice Stevens. She makes school a haven, a place where someone really gets him and sees the music in his being.\\n\\nRay\\'s early training in Keep Calm and Carry On within the loving bosom of his family pays off. That ability to focus is his superpower. It leads him to the *pinnacle* of a violin soloist\\'s ambitions: the International Tchaikovsky Competition, a quadrennial classical-music Olympics that unquestionably makes a musician\\'s career. Even competing there is a leg up...and for a Black man raised with nothing, it is damned near unprecedented for him to be there.\\n\\nThat? That\\'s enough novel for most of us. But Author Slocumb said, \"...now, what happens if the Black man happens to get a Stradivarius from his grandmother...?\"\\n\\nWhat happens is betrayal, heartbreak, and the kind of publicity you damn sure can\\'t pay for. Broken hearts mend; wounds don\\'t fester forever; a career launched into the stratosphere by a juicy scandal leads to a lifetime of opportunities. Ones Ray\\'s absolutely up to taking full advantage of, coming away with a silver medal in spite of the horrors around his violin\\'s rape from him. This one unique possession, it will surprise no one to learn, opens so many doors to him. It will not surprise anyone, either, that he walks boldly up to the doors expecting them to open...and they do.\\n\\nRay\\'s search for the thief of his prized possession, his almost desperate desire not to believe where the search leads him, and his dogged perseverance through it all speak volumes for the value of adversity surmounted in creating character. I think Author Slocumb did exactly the right thing by enabling Ray to reach back, to offer a hand of fellowship from his place of privilege.\\n\\nIt is the thing that defines my memory of Ray McMillian, fictional character: He worked his ass off, he focused on the problem at hand, and he stomped the daylights out of the inner voices installed early that demanded he think about unimportant stuff instead of powering himself, supercharging his gifts with well-honed talents.\\n\\nIn the end, what matters in a life? Looking back, what difference does any of what we do make?\\n\\nThat\\'s Dr. Janice Stevens, if you\\'re wondering, having a ghostly chat with post-disaster Ray. Thanks, Janice.

       " \"2023 Tournament of Books Shortlist\\nThis debut novel by professional violinist Slocumb comes packaged as a mystery about a stolen Stradivarius, but at the core, it's a coming-of-age tale about a young Black men who struggles to make it in the world of classical music, where performers are expected to be white. Protagonist Ray inherits a fiddle from his grandmother, practices religiously, and soon becomes known as a prodigy. When the instrument is inspected for restoration, it turns out it's a 10 million dollar Strad with a dark backstory that slowly reveals itself as the story progresses. While Ray aims to partake in a prestigious music competition, his family tries to convince him to sell the fiddle and make all of them rich, while a white family claims ownership as well.

It's also a celebration of music as a universal language that ultimately can't be turned into a weapon to exclude, but encompasses everyone. And sure, this is not the most literary text ever written, but it's captivating, intelligent, and fun, and the fact that a real musician illustrates the scene gives it depth and vividness.\\n\\nA compelling read, rendered by a writer who knows what he's talking about.

In a nutshell, the book is about a young black man in his 20\\'s (Ray McMillian) who is a talented classical violinist. He was given a family heirloom by his beloved grandmother - a violin which had belonged to his great great grandfather (Pop Pop). The violin turns out to be priceless, much to the surprise of Ray\\'s family and Ray himself.\\n\\nThe novel tells the story of the violin\\'s theft and segues into a whodunnit. There are red herrings galore. As the violin is estimated to be worth 10 million dollars, the FBI is involved as well as a detective from Ray\\'s insurance company - the stalwart Alicia Childress. They investigate a variety of possible suspects, including Ray\\'s family (portrayed as grasping and greedy) and the descendants of the white family who had owned Pop Pop as a slave. They say that the violin is theirs.\\n\\nOn a different level, this is the story of Ray\\'s growing up as a musically talented black boy who is misunderstood by everyone in his family, except his grandmother and one aunt. His mother tells Ray to drop out of high school and work at Pop Eye\\'s (never mind that Ray can get a music scholarship to college).\\n\\nRay also encounters racist reactions from whites who disbelieve that he can be a classically trained musician.\\n\\nPer the author, the character of Ray is largely based upon himself.

She had gone, but she had given him music, and music had filled his world, that allowed him to connect with people in a way that he sometimes could not believe could ever be real. But now she was gone, and the violin had gone, and the music had gone, and he felt so lonely and guilty now that he often thought the misery would paralyze him and he would simply, suddenly, stop breathing under the weight of it.”\\n\\nRay McMillian has to play a crappy school-issued violin, and he loves to play. His family can’t afford private lessons, but even if the money had been available his mother would have never paid for the lessons or a better violin. To say that she was unsupportive would be an understatement. Fortunately, there are 2 women who change his life forever. His Grandma Nora gives him a decrepit old violin that had been given to her grandfather by Marks, the man who owned him. Janice is a college professor who recognizes and nourishes Ray’s drive and talent as she mentors him. One other event that shapes Ray’s life is the discovery that the old fiddle was actually made by Antonio Stradivari and is worth $10 million.\\n\\nThe book begins with the theft of Ray’s violin accompanied by a $5 million ransom demand (despite the enormous care he took to protect it), and then goes back a few years to Ray’s early experiences with the violin and his family. Once the value of the violin is discovered, his family demands their share. The Marks family also comes out of the woodworks and claims the violin. Ray refuses to either sell or return the violin. One of the best parts of this book is the way the author (a music teacher and violinist) makes the reader feel Ray’s love of music and the joy he takes in playing the violin, especially this particular violin. “The opening adagio starts out rich and full, slightly mournful, announcing its presence with passion and wistfulness; and then it lightens, begins to dance, bob along in the current of life: excitement and great joy competing, soaring, grateful, and alive. The violin took over: he wasn’t playing notes he was making music the way Ravel intended, the way Antonio Stradivari intended, the way he always dreamed he could play. He poured out into the air what he was unable to put into words: his gratitude — for this violin, for Janice, for Grandma Nora, for Mischa Roland’s assessment — a few words transforming his life utterly. Thank you.”\\n\\nRay faces racism from employers, orchestras stereotype him and assume that a Black violinist can’t play classical music. Fortunately, Ray is strong, and not cowed by this. To an orchestra that assumes he can play only Gershwin, he says: “I need you to understand something. I am a musician. I happen to be Black. That doesn’t mean that I am any less skilled or knowledgeable than any musician of any other race. You might want to invest in some diversity training, rather than paying for a soloist. Get your act together and I may come and play for you one day. Best of luck.”\\n\\nAt the time the violin is stolen Ray is preparing for the Tchaikovsky Competition, held every 4 years and judged by classical musicians and conductors. Art crime experts try to track the violin, but as Ray sees it there are only 3 possible suspects for the theft - his family, the Marks family or his chief rival in the competition. The mystery continues as Ray participates in the competition.\\n\\nThe story of Ray and his violin was really excellent. This was the author’s first book and he was clearly writing about subjects that he knows well.\\n\\nI received a free copy of this book from the publisher.',\n",
       " 'Advertised as literary fiction and mystery thriller, The Violin Conspiracy by Brendan Slocumb is his debut novel. While obviously based in his own experience, this is a gentle crime ode to musicians and their teachers. A long-forgotten violin in his grandmother’s attic is given to Ray McMillian, a black youth. Forgoing his family’s expectation to be a retail worker, he instead is discovered and develops into a concert soloist. His life is difficult enough, with constant financial demands from his family, a litigation over the disputed ownership of the violin and then his violin is stolen.

       " 'My introduction to the fiction of Brendan Slocumb is his debut novel The Violin Conspiracy. Published in 2022, this mystery draws heavily from the life of its author, a public and private school music educator for twenty-three years. His novel worked a spell on me because at face value it\\'s impossible to ignore how pedestrian it is. Most of the book is telling and much of it deviates from the international thriller genre for the account of a young classical musician and his special violin. Yet I found myself flipping the pages needing to find out what would happen next.\\n\\nRayquan McMillan returns to Charlotte from a performance in New York, where he spent time with his loyal girlfriend Nicole, a violist from the city of Erie. Opening his violin case, Ray discovers a Chuck Taylor shoe and a ransom demand for $5 million. The thief can demand this sum because Ray\\'s missing violin is a three-hundred-year-old Stradivarius, a prized string which beyond its $10 million auction value, Ray has a personal connection to. The Strad was passed down to him by his grandmother from her grandfather, a slave who was granted his freedom along with what they always regarded as an old fiddle.\\n\\nThe NYPD, the FBI Art Crime Unit and an insurance company art detective find their leads exhausted quickly. Ray\\'s suspicion falls instantly to two parties. Andrea and Dante Marks are descendants of the slave owner who Ray\\'s grandmother maintained gave the fiddle to her grandfather. The Marks have confronted Ray in person with their shameless claims as well as filed a lawsuit. So has Ray\\'s family, several of whom contend the fiddle belongs to all of them. Ray maintains that he has no intention of handing the violin over to anyone or selling it, seeking to honor his grandmother\\'s wish that he play it.\\n\\nRay recounts a childhood where he faced contempt and misunderstanding by much of his family as well as bigotry and hatred from those unwilling to accept a Black classical musician.\\n\\n\\n\\nnone of it mattered at all.\\n\\nalways\\n\\n(the title suggests a variation on which is not what the novel is at all, thankfully) isn\\'t compelling because of its mystery. A more skilled author would\\'ve made the art detective or perhaps the FBI\\'s Art Crime unit the focus and ratcheted up the international intrigue with more finesse. What makes the book good is its focus on Ray, on the challenges he faces not only as a Black classical musician out in the world, but at home. His father is out of the picture and his own mother is so dismissive of his goals --classical music is \"noise\"--that she tells him to get a job at Popeyes Chicken.\\n\\nThis a Cinderella story and when told well or from a unique perspective, they work. Surrounded by negativity, Ray believes there\\'s something better for him out there. He ignores what others tell him, continues to believe in himself, practices his art and being a good person. Ray\\'s faerie godmother is named Janice Stevens, his college violin teacher and a manager of sorts. She has his fiddle appraised and abracadabra, notifies him of its immense value. Ray\\'s life is transformed but success brings more problems. I rooted for Ray to overcome these and kill it at the ball and couldn\\'t put the book down until I learned how the tale would resolve itself.',\n",

       " 'I am always a bit wary when an author writes a sequel in response to demand from fans, especially when the first book was a domestic thriller that wrapped up pretty well. Are they just appeasing their audience or do they really have something else left to say?\\n\\nWell, turns out Jewell had quite a bit left to say about the now-grown occupants of 16 Cheyne Walk.\\n\\nThis sequel started with a dead body, as these thrillers often do, and the opening of a twenty year old mystery. But what this leads into is more and more family drama, multiple twisting subplots that eventually, over the course of time, wind together and paint a bigger picture.\\n\\nRachel\\'s story kept me mesmerized and horrified (warning to those sensitive to scenes of sexual assault and emotional abuse), made somehow even more satisfying by the fact that the book begins with the conclusion to her story and we get to sit through the backstory in wide-eyed anticipation of what\\'s to come.\\n\\nI also find Henry a fascinating character and another major reason I enjoyed this book so much. As other characters in the book point out, he is certainly a twisted, messed up person, but I enjoyed reading about him, getting his perspective and more glimpses inside his head. You are never quite sure what he is going to do next, even while reading his first person perspective, which keeps the narrative exciting.\\n\\nOne thing I do think-- the blurb of this book calls it a \"standalone sequel\" which I disagree with. While I don\\'t think it\\'s necessary to go reread to refresh your memory, as the book does contain reminders, there\\'s a lot of characterization and backstory that would be missing here if you jumped straight into this book without reading the first.',\n",
       " \"Even though Lisa Jewell remains one of my favorite writers in this genre I have always maintained that The Family Upstairs is probably my least favorite among her books. Guess what? The Family Remains changed that and how!\\n\\nThe Family Upstairs left me with some unanswered questions. I had hoped (Lesson Learned: Be careful what you wish for!) that the sequel would answer those questions and redeem the previous book in my eyes. Were my questions answered? Yes! But to be honest, I think living with those questions would have been more satisfying than having to endure The Family Remains. I try not to DNF books out of respect for the author’s hard work, but this book really tried my patience. My buddy read with SabiReads (you can read her review ) was what helped me read through to the end.\\n\\nAs the story begins, we see Lucy, Henry and Libby carrying on with their lives after the events in the previous book. A trip to Botswana to meet Phin is planned but falls through when Phin leaves Botswana when he finds out about their upcoming visit. Henry is adamant about finding Phin and following certain leads ends up in Chicago, temporarily severing contact with his sister and her kids who, however, track him down and promptly follow him to the Windy City. There is absolutely no character development for any of the main characters in the novel. Yes, we have a new character, Rachel, Lucy’s ex-husband Michael’s second wife, whose perspective is shared as part of the narrative and is of absolutely no consequence except to serve as a filler for what is overall a weak and underdeveloped story. We already knew Michael was an abusive husband with shady dealings. It was indicated in the previous book that Lucy was not a suspect in his murder and the case was closed. So why reintroduce that plot point here for the sake of a twist that again is of no consequence? We also have a bag of bones discovered by a mud–larker in the Thames which connects to the house of horrors that has since been sold off to a new owner. An investigation into the identity of the deceased is launched and the past comes back to haunt the family! We have an investigator who appears now and then but again he remains always one step behind.\\n\\nThe initial 50% was boring with not much happening but the background of the story (events of the previous book) being mentioned quite a few times and Henry’s obsessive search for Phin (therefore, if you haven’t read the first book, you won’t have much problem following this one since the basic details about past events are mentioned frequently). The only interesting (though immensely unlikeable) character in this story is Henry whose obsession with Phin is the only engaging part of the narrative but only up to a point because after all that build-up, the climax will either have you rolling your eyes and/or laughing at its absurdity and/or throwing the book at the nearest wall in frustration (please take care not to do that if you’re using your e-reader, it’s not worth it!)\\n\\nNeedless to say, this was a disappointing read. I am aware mine is an outlier opinion so you might want to go through other reviews before you decide on this one. Many have liked this novel more than I have. It pains me to rate a Lisa Jewell novel this low but there is absolutely nothing about this book I feel good about. After reading this one, I'm left with only one question: What was the purpose of this sequel?\",\n",
       " 'Happy belated book birthday!🥳🍾💃🏻📚\\nWow! I was so thrilled to read this book! Because that creepy, intense, extremely eerie, spin tingling “Family Upstairs” book rocked my world! When I learned there was sequel, I screamed “yes, please, I need this!”\\n\\nI have to advise you to read or reread the first book again to get into this story because this is not a standalone and without knowing the characters’ back stories and things happened that haunted mansion that invaded by parasites who act like cult members, you find yourself left in the dark!\\n\\nActually : this book is not a mystery or thriller. Of course there’s a crime investigation conducting by DI Samuel Owosu after a mud larking professional found bones of 25 years old ballerina thrown at Thames River.\\n\\nAnd Michael Raimes found murdered brutally at his house in France , the very same man was married with Lucy Lamb: one of the victims who has been raped and abused at the mad house!\\nBut those mysteries unfolded so slowly! The reason you’re so drawn into this sequel: your desire to find out what happened to those characters! This book is a CLOSURE! In my opinion, the way how things conclude is so fair!\\n\\nI have to remind you how the story ended at the first book:\\nInnocent, famished, tortured, psychically and psychologically abused kids accomplished to escape from the mad house and that evil couple David and Birdie: scarier than Natural Born Killers’ Mickey and Mallory got what they deserved. The little baby Serenity is raised by foster parents, becoming very nice, gold hearted young lady called Libby inherited the mad house and learned the traumatic truth about her parents, having a fulfilled relationship with her journalist boyfriend Miller who wrote an article about mad house!\\n\\nAnd as I told, the bones of a young woman found in Thames and another murder case in France may be linked to the Lamb siblings!\\nWhat happened to them exactly?\\n\\nLucy moves Henry’s house with her two teenage children, reconnecting with her daughter Libby, looking for her own house with the help of inheritance money her daughter kindly shared with her and uncle Henry.\\n\\nThey also found traces of Phineas, living in Botswana. They even plan a family reunion but Lucy finds out Phin already hit the road as soon as he found out their intention.\\n\\nHenry who is not only using Phineas’ name, but his looks with his bleached hair and reconstructed face, whitened teeth has no intention to give up so easily. We know how obsessed with Phin and his obsession grew throughout the years. But what will he do when he finds him? In the past things got escalated between them. Henry already chained him to the radiator and forced him drink love position that poisoned, didn’t he?\\n\\nI tried to give a quick recap of the events from the first book and extra information about new storyline.\\n\\nMy last conclusions:\\nDon’t read this book as a mystery, just read it to find out the closures of the characters. It was perfectly and honestly written. Henry was the most interesting, complex, dark and broken character of the book and I absolutely loved his POVs. His character reminded me of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho ( especially his future life, his extra meticulousness, his obsessions, his luxurious life style, his troubled emotional state) I easily connected with him and in my opinion he definitely deserved a second chance after what he’s been through like all the others.\\n\\nQuick note: As a big fan who devours Double Double burgers weekly , I found a FALSE INFORMATION in the chapter 45! There’s no In&Out Burger store in Chicago. The spokesman of In&Out already told that they don’t have any plans to do so. That information has to be corrected.\\n\\nOverall: I love the conclusion and I enjoyed to revisit the characters of the book who are middle aged in the new book and I am so happy Michael got what he deserved.\\n\\nLisa Jewell is my all time favorite authors! I read anything she writes with full contentment by canceling everything in my life.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.',\n",
       " 'The Family Remains returns to the lives of the characters from The Family Upstairs. A body has been found washed up in the Thames and in a house in Antibes. Will the detectives be able to unravel the mystery and find out what really happened all those years ago?\\n\\nI absolutely loved The Family Upstairs, unfortunately this sequel didn’t have quite the same tension and atmosphere that I loved so much in the first book. The pacing felt slower, more of a police procedural than an edge of your seat thriller. It became a little repetitive after a while, I just wanted everything to hurry up. That being said, it was always going to be difficult to live up to the first book for me!\\n\\nI love Jewell’s ability to create such incredibly complex characters. Henry is one of the most interesting characters I’ve ever come across. I love taking a dive into his psychology and really enjoyed the depth this book gave to his character. I still have absolutely no idea how I feel about him, and that is fine by me. I also found myself getting a little emotional near the end, I really liked how Jewell wrapped this up, although it may not be to everyone’s tastes. I also loved that some incredibly important issues were tackled in this book, but they were handled with sensitivity. There was a real sense of female empowerment which warmed my heart. I definitely can’t wait to read more by this author, even if I didn’t love this one quite as much as the first book.\\n\\nI would recommend this to fans of police procedurals or anyone who enjoyed the first book (although you don’t need to have read the first one to follow the storyline in this book). I want to thank Najma Finlay, Penguin Random House and Lisa Jewell for allowing me to read a copy of this book in exchange for my personal thoughts.',\n",
       " \"The Family Remains by Lisa Jewell\\nNarrated by Dominic Thorburn, Bea Holland, Hugh Quarshie, Josh Dylan\\n\\nA year ago I listened to The Family Upstairs, the first book in the Family Upstairs series. The Family Remains is the second book (will there be more?) in the series and it's just as confusing, disturbing, and creepy as the first book. Of course it is, we still have some of the weird characters from the first book, going strong, and doing all their creepy things to other people.\\n\\nI remembered the first book mostly although the details eluded me until this book reminded me, very well, of what exactly had happened in the first book. Because this book does such a good job of going over past events, I can see how someone could read this book and understand what is going on, more or less. But I think that the story has more meaning if you do read the first book before you read this one. It's not a pretty story, bad things happened in the past and they are happening in this book, too.\\n\\nThere are multiple timelines that are well defined and I felt such dread with the earlier timelines. As with the other book, there is physical, mental, and emotional abuse that is very distressing to read/hear. It was once we got away from the character of Henry that I really got into this story. I care so much for Lucy and her two clever kids. Marco is just the smartest thing and I loved his scenes. There are also new characters in this story that made an impression on me. At some point, I had to know what was going to happen despite all the disturbing things going on. This story won't appeal to everyone, just like the first book didn't appeal to everyone. But I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind seeing some of these characters again except that I know one of them remains as creepy and disturbing as ever.\\n\\nFirst pub July 26, 2022\",\n",

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.\\n\\nWriting: 3/5 | Plot: MIA/5 | Ending: pls say sike/5\\n\\nSYNOPSIS\\n\\nI... I honestly can\\'t even describe this. Uhh... Henry Lamb goes full stalker trying to find Finn. Lucy and her kidlets try to stop him. Some bones are found in the House of Horrors that are prob gonna unearth some unsavoury secrets.\\n\\n\\n\\nL M F A O. Ya\\'ll know what time it is... BUCKLE TF UP, IT\\'S GONNA BE A ROUGH ONE!!!\\n\\nFirst things first, I did not read book #1. However, I did read a super long spoiler review of it to get a grasp on wassup because I was mad confused at first. My rating does not reflect the fact I didn\\'t read #1... so pls refrain from the \"YoU nEeD tO rEaD tHe FiRsT oNe\" comments, respectfully.\\n\\nOk. I\\'m actually cackling because idk where to start. So after the bones are found we don\\'t hear about them again for another 100 pgs or so. It\\'s all about Henry doing THEE absolute most and breaking about 2409104 laws. I mean I have to respect the fact he\\'s so painfully self-aware at times but then bops are Chicago and asks 400+ ppl if they\\'ve seen this man without any reservations. I can\\'t even call a resto to make a reservation so you gotta admire the man\\'s ability to talk to strangers during his stalkapade (stalking + escapade) .\\n\\nThe book wasn\\'t terrible until the last 25% or so. I was going to give it a generous three stars because I was caught up in the drama of it all, but then Lisa Jewell said HOLD MY BEER and this story nosedived into one-star territory at the speed of light.\\n\\nHere are my main complaints:\\n\\n1. Rachel was useless. Literally you could\\'ve just revealed Lucy\\'s big ole secret through a series of flashbacks. Why did we need Rachel other than to give her Ted Talk on BDSM and marital rape? She was kinda like Lowen in Verity.\\n\\n2. Detective Sam was weird. Idk why but I was picturing Slender Man the entire time. There was one part where he didn\\'t like a dog because its body was too long. Not the overall size of the dog, just the length of its body. It was some sort of Terrier. So what if the dog had a short body but really long legs? Would that be okay? I just didn\\'t know what I was supposed to learn from this whole dog comment. Why was it relevant? Also I literally cackled in the dark when he was like \"yo I KNOW that X died here.\" and his partner was like \"oh ya how?\" and he goes \"just the vibe of the place. \" LMAOOO I\\'m not even joking, he said evidence? Nah. VIBES. VIBRAS!!!\\n\\n3. Lisa Jewell is the Great Value Sharon Bolton. Yeah I said it. Whereas Bolton can masterfully craft some quirky characters (think of the gypsy fam from Dead Woman Walking) and slanted dialogue, Jewell is the Olympic diver who belly flops into the pool. She tries, but she just doesn\\'t have the chops. I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n4. I get that it\\'s fiction, but some of the shit that occurred in this book would\\'ve been better suited for a cozy mystery. It was just TOO fictional if you know what I mean. I\\'m not a fan of an author aiming for some kind of mind-bending, literary masterpiece that can\\'t execute a simple Google search to verify some basic information. If this book had a pic of a cat eating lasagna with a baddie standing in the window holding a vial of posion and was titled 2 Hot 2 Handle then I\\'d be like ight, this drama is kinda fun or whatever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpanding on #4... This was officially one star when Henry and Lucy reentered the UK with their fake passports AFTER Interpol had located them and they were questioned by the police. BRUH. You\\'re telling me that Interpol wouldn\\'t be waiting for you on the tarmac as soon as you landed to confiscate your fake documents and put you in jail? Instead Henry is like well they need us here so duh they still work! No... Just no. Once again, I\\'d let this slide in the 2 hot 2 handle cozy, but not in a book that\\'s aiming for something more serious. This is just nonsense. You committed a serious crime and you\\'re just in the streets because some small town Detective wants to keep an eye on you?? PLZ SIR!!!\\n\\n5. Henry. Oh Henry. What was he supposed to be? A protagonist? An antagonist? An antagonistic hero? He was wilding to the max and then his lil redemption was connecting Finn with his daughter. Okay???? And what about his full-fledged stalking with the initial intent to make luv in da club to him (without consent most likely)? We just gonna blow right past that??\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOk I\\'m cutting myself off lmao. Anyways. I\\'m obviously an outlier (what\\'s new) but really this book just fell a part in the last 25% and I couldn\\'t in good conscience give it anything higher than a one.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros: the first 3/4 were tolerable\\n\\nCons: the last 1/4 was so terrible it earned one star overall',\n",

       " '4.0 stars— I read “The Family Remains” by Lisa Jewell not knowing it was a sequel to “The Family Upstairs”. Oops. It is a credit to Jewell that I was able to keep up with a story that has a multitude of characters with multiple aliases and backstories with the help of the handy family tree she includes at the beginning of the book. The story itself is interesting and Jewell keeps you in the dark about what the complete story is and how three distinct story lines are connected for the majority of the book. The first storyline follows Henry Lamb aka Phineas Thomson as he attempts to find the real Phineas Thomsen for unspecified reasons in Chicago. The author slowly reveals the backstory as why this is concerning for Henry’s family who is desperately trying to find him. Another storyline follows Rachel and her dysfunctional relationship with her husband,Michael, and the third storyline follows a police investigation into the identity of twenty plus year old human remains found near the Thames River. Do not drift off while reading this one with all of the characters and storylines you will have to go back and re-read portions of the book in order for it to make sense(🙋🏻\\u200d♂️..guilty). The book as a whole is very different and the characters are difficult to relate to, but because Jewell is such a good writer with the ability to brilliantly connect all three storylines, weird or not 4 stars it is.

       " \"This is the sequel to Lisa Jewell's chilling The Family Upstairs, a top notch multilayered and intricate psychological thriller with its old and new characters. Jewell weaves her magic with her disturbed and unsettling storytelling, in which there are mysteries and surprising connections are made. In London, a mudlark discovers a washed up bag of bones on the banks of the River Thames. The bones are those of a young woman who had suffered blunt force trauma, DCI Samuel Owusu investigates as forensic evidence leads him to a Chelsea mansion in Cheyne Walk where 3 decades ago, three dead bodies were found in the kitchen. We become reacquainted with the Lamb family, Lucy, with her two children, Marco and Stella, her brother, Henry, and Libby, haunted by the trauma of their past. The novel is relayed through the perspectives of the various characters.\\n\\nRachel Rimmer had married the seemingly perfect Michael perhaps rather too quickly, the abusive Michael is Lucy's ex, and he has now been found dead at his home in France and the French police want to talk to her. Lucy is living with her brother, and seeking safety, stability and security after experiencing a challenging set of circumstances and periods of homelessness. The fragile and lonely Henry, with his self-esteem issues, is feeling a tangle of mixed emotions and feelings, not all straight forward, he is obsessed with Phin Thomsen, wanting to know where he is, with rumours of him being in Africa. This is a dark, intense and thrilling read, never less than compelling, which includes trauma, blackmail, abuse, murder, in this superior narrative where the separate threads are expertly woven together and connected.\\n\\nI would definitely suggest and recommend reading The Family Upstairs before beginning this novel.

Libby Jones (birth name Serenity Lamb) has grown close to her biological mother, Lucy Lamb, her uncle, Henry Lamb, half-brother Marco, and half-sister Stella. Plus she is bound to them by the shocking shared truth of the horrors that occurred at – her family home turned cult, the property she inherited from her grandparents. She has recently sold the Chelsea house, given all the bad things that happened there, and split the proceeds of the sale with her mother and uncle. Libby is also keen to track down her birth father – Phineas (Phin) Thomsen (son of cult leader David Thomsen) – who has been missing for over twenty-five years.\\n\\nThe remains of Birdie Dunlop-Evers (one of the cult follows who abused Henry, Lucy, Phil, and his sister Clemency) have also been discovered by police, put there by Henry, who killed Birdie twenty-six years ago in self-defence to protect baby Serenity/Libby.\\n\\nA second (more recent) body has been discovered in Antibes, France, belonging to Michael Rimmer, Lucy’s abusive ex-husband and Marco’s father, who she killed (also in self-defence) after he attacked her.\\n\\nThe past is catching up with the Lamb family.\\n\\nWith me so far? Honestly there was so much to remember from the first book. I highly recommend skim-reading it like I did, or at least have a copy handy to refer to if you get lost. POV’s alternated between Henry, Lucy, and Marco (and their search for Phin), DCI Samuel Owusu (investigating Birdie’s murder), and Rachel Gold (Michael Rimmer’s second wife). This is going to sound weird, but even though this was an engrossing read, with top-notch writing, I don’t think a sequel was really needed. Don’t get me wrong, it was great to re-visit these characters, I was emotionally invested, and I appreciated the closure regarding certain characters fates, but by the end of this book, I felt we were at the same place as the end of . Rachel’s story arc was my favourite, likely because she was a new character with a fresh take, but the hunt for Phin became rather tedious in the second half. Also, I really missed Libby’s POV, and thought she would’ve had more of an active role in the search for her father.\\n\\nFurthermore, I would categorise Henry, Lucy, and Marco’s story as more family drama/secrets/tragedy, with Rachel’s being more domestic thriller, and a dash of police procedural thrown in.\\n\\nAn above average read, which I think fans of will appreciate, but I preferred\\n\\n\\n\\nPublication Date:',\n",
       " '3.5 stars: Lisa Jewell continues to deliver! “The Family Remains” isn’t as unsettling as “The Family Upstairs”, and it lacks the same thriller pacing; yet I found it to be a satisfying read.\\n\\nIt’s been three years since “The Family Upstairs”, and it all came back to me as soon as I began reading “Remains”. I don’t think it’s necessary to have read the first one prior to reading “Remains”. In fact, Jewell adds another character, Rachel, who is struggling to separate herself from her abusive ex-husband.\\n\\nLucy Lamb is living with her brother Henry and her two young children. Lucy had a baby, Serenity, in the last novel. Lucy and Henry needed to escape their home and needed to leave the baby, Serenity was renamed Libby; Libby inherited a sizable sum when she turned twenty-five. Lucy and Henry have kept in contact with adult Libby, as they knew she would inherit the money at the age of 25. Henry was the most disturbed of the children living in the house of the last novel. Jewell keeps his sketchy nature in this story as well which adds to the unnerving feeling of this thriller. Libby tracks down her birth father and wants to reunite. At one point, Henry goes rogue. Rachel connects with Lucy. A Police Inspector gets involved when a barrel of bones, connected to the house that Libby inherited.\\n\\nIn Jewell fashion, she keeps her chapters short. She adds tension with dual timelines and the Police Inspector’s investigation uprooting Lucy’s goal of reuniting her family.\\n\\nJewell is a solid thriller author. I have never been disappointed with her work.',\n",

I read Book 1 in this series a few years ago so some details weren’t as fresh in my mind as I would have liked, however, Lisa Jewell had me hooked and hanging on every word regardless. I was able to put most the pieces of the characters lives and plot backstory together with the little reminders scattered throughout the book. I enjoyed being lost in the mystery of what was happening to this family (again). Following along on their quirky, dark and unforgettable journey was extremely entertaining.\\n\\nThe plot unfolds through multiple perspectives and timelines which flowed brilliantly. Each perspective added the perfect layer of tension, mystery and intrigue. I really enjoyed the police investigation sections and thought those new characters were a fantastic addition.\\n\\nOverall, a highly enjoyable read! I loved spending more time with these characters. I highly recommend this series and strongly encourage you to pick up Book 1 first in order to get the full Lamb family experience.

However, it was helpful for me to have read the first book beforehand.\\n\\nThere are many characters, but Google helped refresh my memory regarding the plot/spoilers in the first book (that I read a few years ago).

       " 'Once again, Lisa Jewel has written a disturbing, off kilter story. She brings back characters from The Family Upstairs - Lucy, Henry, Phinn and Libby. There are multiple plot lines and multiple POVs. We’re first introduced to a detective whose case involves 20 year old bones found by a mudlarker. Then there’s Rachel Rimmer, who’s just learned her husband has been killed in their home in Nice. Her story also goes back and forth in time and we get the background of their relationship. Meanwhile, Henry is on the hunt for Finn/Phinn. He’s had an obsession with him for the past thirty years and has finally gotten a bead on where he might be. And Lucy is trying to track down Henry. It’s gradually revealed how some of the characters are intertwined and the common theme between these stories.\\nMost of these characters are off. Of course, if you read the first book, you will understand their background.\\nThe book is purposefully convoluted but at times it just felt too disorienting. In the beginning, I debated abandoning this, but wanted to see how Jewel would bring it all together. I was impressed by the ending.\\nThere are multiple sex scenes, some of them graphic. The theme at the heart of the stories is disturbing.\\nThe story is narrated by a cast of six. But none of them really impressed me. It also was an issue that when one narrator had to do the voice of another’s character, there was no similarity.',\n",

       " 'I had read The Family Upstairs so long ago that I worried that I would not be able to connect with and enjoy The Family Remains, the sequel to The Family Upstairs by Lisa Jewell. Leave it to Lisa Jewell, though, to pull off this captivating and suspenseful sequel! As I listened to the audiobook of The Family Remains, I was drawn into this perfectly plotted suspense/mystery. All the sinister and creepy details about The Family Upstairs came flooding back to me with Lisa Jewell’s help as she referenced many of the details throughout the sequel. I was happy to discover that The Family Remains tied up many of the loose ends from her previous book, The Family Upstairs. The Family Remains brought a sense of closure for me. It answered many of the questions that remained unanswered at the end of The Family Upstairs. The Family Remains was well paced and had several twists which Lisa Jewell is known for. The characters, old and new, were twisted, troubled and complex.\\n\\nSeveral decades after the three adult bodies were found dead on the kitchen floor of the home at 16 Cheyne Walk, a bag of bones was discovered on the shores on The Thames River. DI Samuel Owusu was alerted about the discovery. He immediately sent the bones, thought to be human, for forensic testing. The examination of these bones led DI Samuel Owusu to reopen a cold case about a missing woman that was last known living at the home on Cheyne Walk. Her family had reported her missing all those years ago but her body or whereabouts were never found. All the new evidence pointed to a connection with the dead bodies found on the kitchen floor all those years ago. There was something else discovered in the bag with the bones that connected that particular house with these bones. DI Samuel Owusu reopened this cold case and was determined to discover what had happened to this person for its bones to be stuffed in a plastic bag and emerge on the bank of The Thames River all these years later. Who had been responsible for committing this crime? Was the bag that contained the bones purposely thrown into the River? DI Samuel Owusu would stop at nothing until he discovered who the murderer was.\\n\\nThirty years after a sister and brother fled from the dysfunctional and unsafe home at 16 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, they are reunited once again in London. Lucy Lamb has returned to London with her two children, Marco and Stella and has moved in with her brother Henry. For Lucy, this was a temporary solution. Both Lucy and Henry were recipients of a very large inheritance that was left to Lucy’s oldest daughter, Libby Jones. The inheritance was awarded to Libby when she turned twenty-five. Libby gladly shared it with Lucy, Libby’s birth mother, and her Uncle Henry. Lucy had plans of finding a home of her own somewhere close to Libby that she, Marco and Stella could live in. While staying at Henry’s apartment, Lucy had this brilliant idea to go on Safari to meet up with Phin again. Phin was living out his childhood dream of being a tour guide for African Safaris. Somehow Phin got wind of their plans and disappeared. Henry was determined to catch up with the boy he loved as a child. He used all the resources and initiatives he could muster to find out where Phin could have gone to. Once Henry discovered that Phin was in Chicago, he set off alone to find him. Soon Lucy discovered where Henry had gone and what he was about to do. Lucy and her children followed Henry to Chicago and all three of them searched for Phineas Thomsen.\\n\\nRachel was a single young woman that was living in London. She had recently lost her mother but had a very close relationship with her father. Her father was well off and offered Rachel a comfortable life style and the ability to design, produce and sell her jewelry. Rachel had met a well to do American man at a bar one night. Months later, that same American man called her and they began to date. Michael Rimmer was not only handsome but he managed to sweep Rachel off her feet. He wined, dined and spoiled her. Michael made her feel special and safe. Before she thought it was possible, Rachel and Michael had fallen in love and were getting married. A little into their exotic honeymoon, though, things changed very quickly. Michael went from being a caring and considerate man and husband to a controlling and verbally abusive husband. Then Rachel’s most dreaded thing happened and she left Michael. A few years later, Rachel received a phone call from the French police informing her that Michael had been discovered dead in the cellar of his French home. Rachel was questioned extensively but in the end it was determined that Michael had been a victim of a home invasion.\\n\\nTwo murders were investigated throughout the plot of The Family Remains. Did the truth about the murders finally surface and reveal themselves by the conclusion of The Family Remains? The Family Remains was a testament to what lengths a family would go to protect the people they love and care about. There were so many secrets throughout the course of this book. By the end, though, the secrets were revealed and dealt with accordingly. All the loose ends came together and resulted in a satisfying ending. I think that it would be helpful to have read The Family Upstairs before reading The Family Remains. However, The Family Remains could be read as a stand alone book because Lisa Jewell does include many details about the previous book in the sequel. I really enjoyed reading The Family Remains and look forward to reading many more books by Lisa Jewell. I highly recommend this book.',\n",

That is, until I just had my mind blown by this upcoming new book! The Family Remains takes place directly after the events from its predecessor, but also provides readers with alternate timelines and point of views to wrap up the next installment of a severely damaged family. I don\\'t want to get into spoilers about this book, especially if you haven\\'t read The Family Upstairs yet, but since this book will be released in the end of July, you should start picking up that book ASAP.\\n\\nThe Family Remains focuses on the Lamb family, mainly Henry, Lucy, and Libby. We get bird\\'s eye views on the family\\'s next steps and their dark turns as they continue to navigate their lives post-trauma during their teenage years. I really loved the personalization of some of the characters that we didn\\'t get in the first book. This book is very character-driven, but also provides the mystery and suspense that you\\'ve come to love with Lisa Jewell novels. I, for one, love Henry Lamb and his \"peculiarities.\" Never has a flawed main character captivated me as a reader since Joe Goldberg in YOU. If this duology doesn\\'t become a television series soon, production companies are missing out.\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing about this book that I would change. Seriously.

She and her oldest daughter, Libby Jones, are beginning to bond as they both are looking to create a new normal. However, when they locate Libby’s father and attempt to set up a visit with him in Botswana, he suddenly pulls up stakes and leaves. Henry gets a lead on where he might have gone and surreptitiously sets out to find him as he’s still obsessed with the man. Meanwhile, the human remains of Bridget Dunlop-Evers, known as Birdie, are discovered by a mudlarker on the shores of the Thames and DCI Samuel Owusu is doggedly determined to find out who killed her. Rachel Rimmer, Lucy’s ex-husband Michael Rimmer’s wife, gives us a view of the man from the time they first met until his death.\\n\\n\\nThere’s so much backstory from the first book I had to read a summary (Googled it!) to remind myself of certain details. It all came flooding back quickly and I got so hooked I abandoned sleep to finish. There’s not a lot of drama, except as it relates to Henry and his relentless pursuit of Phin. We know what he’s capable of so it was beyond creepy. Lucy has also taken her children with her to chase behind Henry, fearing he’d do something rash. Rachel’s point of view was extremely compelling, especially after knowing her as a self assured modern woman who’s taken in by Michael’s veneer. I was so invested in what happened to her and couldn’t wait until the story would transition back to her. DCI Owusu is always in the background, his investigation creeping closer to the truth of what happened in that house of horrors where the children were raised.\\n\\n\\nI was in heaven listening to this full cast narration. Everyone delivered the performance I needed, especially Dominic Thorburn as Henry. He was that man, full of arrogance and a little bit of crazy. This was the best in audiobook listening experiences.\\n\\n\\nI was satisfied with the ending in the first book but still had lots of unresolved issues that this story answered. It totally enthralled me as I worried for Phin, got caught up in Rachel’s unfolding drama and felt the tension brought on by DCI Owusu as he closed in on the Lambs. My expectations were high and this still managed to surpass them. I’m sparse on details for a reason and highly recommend the book in any format but the audio version is special. Jewell is an auto listen and remains so. It feels like we’ve seen the last of this family but there was a tiny little crack opened for possibly more. If so, I’m definitely in!\\n\\n\\n\\n(Thanks to Simon & Schuster Audio for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)',\n",

       " \"**4.5-stars rounded up**\\n\\nThe Overnight Guest is the second novel I have read from Heather Gudenkauf. The first was her 2020-release, This Is How I Lied, which I really enjoyed, ultimately giving it 3.5-stars and rounding up.\\n\\nIn this one, I feel like Gudenkauf's writing is elevated to a whole new level! I was impressed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWylie Lark is a True Crime writer. In the course of her work, she frequently travels to the locations where the crimes she is writing about have taken place.\\n\\nShe currently finds herself alone, staying at a remote farmhouse where a brutal double homicide once occurred, with a vicious snowstorm bearing down on her.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs horrifying as this may sound to some, Wylie isn't concerned. She's got a fireplace and enough supplies to last her until the storm passes.\\n\\nWhen her dog alerts her to something he has found just outside the house, Wylie expects it to be some sort of animal, who wasn't able to find shelter in time and succumbed to the elements. What she doesn't expect is for it to be a child, half-frozen and unresponsive.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the truth of the child's sudden appearance begins to be revealed, Wylie realizes she may not be as alone as she once thought.\\n\\nWill she be able to protect the child, and herself, from the dangers lurking outside long enough to be able to reach help?\\n\\n\\n\\nY'all, this novel is intensely-gripping. It follows both Wylie's present timeline, as well as the perspective and timeline of a girl who lived in the house at the time of the gruesome murders.\\n\\nBut that's not all! There's a third perspective of a child that is quite disturbing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way Gudenkauf paced out the reveals of each perspective, drawing them together into one unsettling conclusion, was so well done. It kept me completely engrossed.\\n\\nThere was some really creepy moments in this. Reading on my kindle, in the dark, while home alone, on the night of a windstorm, I'll admit to being scared. I had to read something else for a bit just in order to be able to sleep that night.\\n\\n\\n\\nI loved the vibes I picked up from this. It wasn't overdone, but felt like a respectful nod to that work.\\n\\nOverall, I had a ton of fun reading this. It featured some of my favorite tropes and was fast-paced and exciting to read. I would definitely recommend this one.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you to the publisher, Park Row Press, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I look forward to reading more from Gudenkauf!\",\n",
       " 'Pretty Good Read!\\n\\n3.75 stars\\n\\nThe Overnight Guest is an atmospheric and gripping thriller about a missing teenage girl linked to a horrific crime and the true-crime writer who attempts to unravel the missing pieces.\\n\\nThere are three central mysteries. One involving a crime from the past. The other two are centered around events in the present. All are linked together.\\n\\nAll of the narratives take place in rural Burden, Iowa. All three are compelling and made me want to keep on reading!\\n\\nOne of the narratives takes place during the hot Summer of 2000. This story revolves around 12-year-old Josie, who witnesses a horrific crime.\\n\\nIn the present moment, we are introduced to Wylie’s perspective. Her story is shared against the backdrop of a blizzard. Wylie, a true-crime writer, has rented a house in Burden to work on her next book. While hunkered down for the blizzard, she discovers an injured boy nearly frozen to death in the snow. She takes him in as her overnight guest.\\n\\nThen there is a story of a little girl. All the reader knows is that she is living in a basement room with her mother.\\n\\nI guessed two out of the three mysteries. Had I been able to keep track of all of the characters and read a little bit closer, it would have been easy to solve the third. While this didn’t have any major surprises, and I guessed what was happening, I enjoyed seeing how the events unfolded.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the downside, there are too many characters and too many perspectives. I also thought that the little girl seemed much older and wiser than her age, adding a layer of unbelievability. The ending was over-the-top and dragged a bit. At the same time, I was left with a lot of unanswered questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Harlequin Trade Publishing in exchange for an honest review.',\n",
       " 'Exciting mystery/thriller!\\n\\nGudenkauf\\'s books are kind of hit or miss for me, but this one is definitely a hit. There are three separate storylines:\\n--Present day with true crime writer Wylie hunkered down in a house in order to finish her book. One night a horrible ice storm hits and Wylie finds a young boy nearly frozen to death. When she brings him into the house he won\\'t speak, and when she goes to investigate where he came from, she finds an injured woman and a wrecked truck.\\n--The year 2000, a family with a rebellious teenage son and a younger teen daughter who has a friend come to stay the night\\n--A woman and her young daughter, the woman is being abused by the girl\\'s father\\n\\nThese seemingly unconnected storylines come together in some surprising ways in the end. I liked the twists the author created and the winter setting that made me shiver and presented the perfect atmosphere for the present day storyline. This is contrasted with the thread from 2000, which takes place during a sweltering summer. The stark difference between the two makes for a very atmospheric tale.\\n\\nI did guess most of what was going on after a bit, but the journey to bring the three threads together is the best part. The narrative moves quickly and kept me engaged throughout. The parts about the mom and the girl had shades of and the abuse was pretty difficult to read, that was my least favorite of the storylines because it felt really \"been there done that\" for any seasoned reader.\\n\\nOverall, it is a captivating tale with some intrigue and surprises that make the book worth reading.\\n\\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.',\n",
       " \"The Overnight Guest by Heather Gudenkauf\\nNarrated by Brittany Pressley\\n\\nTrue crime writer Wylie Lark likes to get right into the scene with her writing. She's actually staying at the location of several long ago murders as she finishes up her latest book. She's isolated herself from everyone and now there is a winter storm that shuts down travel. Power and telephone lines could be next. Not to worry, she has enough of everything she needs to last a few days before she'll need more supplies.\\n\\nWhen she finds a small child on her driveway, under the snow, things get more dire. But still, there is nothing she can do at the moment, other than take care of the child as best she can. But the child won't speak to her and seems scared of her. Eventually Wylie goes out to search for a few answers and finds out way more than she expected.\\n\\nThere are two timelines and I enjoyed the earlier timeline the most. The present day timeline was interesting, for the most part, but towards the end of the story, I liked it less and less. Too many coincidences and dumb things done. But worst of all for me was Wiley. I didn't care for her hysterics (I'm not saying whether they were justified or not). Wiley doesn't seem very good at interacting with people and her voice acting made her come across as a shrill shrew. I felt like she'd be abrasive if I was reading the story so I think the narration would have worked better for me if the acting was toned down. Too much Wiley was not a good thing for me.\\n\\nI figured out a lot of things before they were revealed but that isn't something I mind. The story had me interested mostly but the actions scenes towards the end of the book seemed so long and tedious. I guess this story wasn't a good fit for me but it's partly because it's a subgenre that I usually avoid. Thank you, Jayme, for letting me blather about this story, even though you read it long ago and don't remember it anymore. 😂\\n\\nFirst published January 25, 2022\",\n",

Who would abandon a little one in the middle of a blizzard?\\n\\nAnd here's where Gudenkauf will switch gears to the year 2000 with the lead-up to the horrendous crime that took place on this farm.

       " '”Zip code was no exemption from violence and death. There was just less concrete and more soil.”\\nIn a world where most books are overly complicated and unnecessarily long, The Overnight Guest is incredibly refreshing for being the exact opposite. It isn’t particularly mind-blowing, but it is a very quick and entertaining read.\\n\\nIn the middle of a blizzard, Wylie Lark, a true crime writer, is shocked to find a malnourished, nearly dead, young child outside of her front door. Wylie must uncover how the little boy got there and what happened to him.\\n\\nWylie is a decent protagonist, but there isn’t anything especially memorable about her. There are so many complex and disturbed protagonists in mysteries and thrillers – , , and in particular – so Wylie felt a bit flat in comparison. Heather Gudenkauf could have developed her character just a bit more, particularly her psychological state.\\n\\nThe mystery here is relatively simple and straightforward. The twists and turns aren’t particularly shocking, but they are fairly realistic and easy to follow. Everything is explained and nicely tied together, which makes for a very satisfying read. A bit less predictability in the reveals and a few more red herrings would have helped elevate this book to another level.\\n\\nis a very solid mystery. While it isn’t the best book ever written, it is a gripping and enjoyable read. True crime fans in particular will enjoy this.',\n",
       " 'Wylie Lark is a true crime writer working on her next book. She’s literally returned to the scene of the crime, staying at the farmhouse where Josie Doyle’s family was murdered twenty years ago in Burden, Iowa. She welcomes the quiet and solitude and was almost finished when a bad snow storm descends. Forced to venture out into it after her dog doesn’t return, she discovers a child laying in the snow, injured from what appears to be the result of a car crash. Wylie manages to get the child back to the house and thus begins another mystery that will threaten her life and that of the child.\\n\\nThe story is told from three points of view, transitioning between present day and the days leading up to the murder of Josie’s family in 2000. All were equally riveting and I couldn’t decide which I wanted to be immersed in at any given time. The last third of the book was impossible to put down as I untangled clues to figure out how they all were supposed to fit together because, of course, they had to. I’m being deliberately vague since it’s a bit tricky to be more detailed.\\n\\nI enjoyed this mystery, made even more exciting by the narrator who excelled at creating distinctive voices for each of the characters, those with a point of view and others. She’s a great storyteller and is one of my favorites. True confession…I figured things out much earlier than when it was revealed but it didn’t matter as that brought on a whole new level of anxiety and anticipation. And, it brought one more little twist I didn’t see coming. This was everything I was hoping it would be and a little bit more.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Thanks to Harlequin Audio for my complimentary copy.

This is the beginning and I was sitting on the couch, looking out my picture window as the snow fell and the wind blew the flakes every which way. A great time to read this story, definitely made it relatable. Well, up to a point.\\n\\nThis is a tense, fast moving story that actually contains three different threads. One in the past, two in the present. How do these stories connect? Unusually for me, I was holding my breath during quite a few moments. I love this author, have now read all but one of her books. She knows how to ratchet up suspense, is very good at it. There is, in one of the threads, a nod to another plot line in a past best seller from another author, but the circumstances and the way it blends into the larger story, is all her own. The twist at the end was surprising but I also felt some of the ending actions were a little much.\\nAll I all though, this was a very good story for those readers who like heightened, suspenseful books.',\n",

Sometimes you really hate them or resent them, but they always find a smart and unique way to get under your skin and charm you with their power, endurance, resilience, and bravery.\\n\\nJust like Carrie Soto did in this book, and just like Daisy Jones, Evelyn Hugo, and Nina Riva had done to us! Both of these amazing heroines changed our worlds! We chanted for them! We screamed at them! We wished for their happiness, and we witnessed their self-growth and their search for the meaning of life!\\n\\nNow let’s focus on who Carrie Soto is!\\n\\nCarrie Soto is a total bitch! She’s born to be a tennis star! Her eyes are always on the ball! The only thing she wants is to be the best, the one, becoming invincible, crushing her opponents, at the expense of winning more enemies and people’s hate! She’s crude! She’s a husband-stealer! But under that ice queen facade, she’s lonely, she’s sensitive, she’s insecure. She secretly thinks people will abandon her as soon as they notice that sensitive part of her, just like the men she’s had one-night stands with and never heard back.\\n\\nHer father Javi was a great tennis player called “Jaguar” who immigrated to the USA from Argentina, finding the love of his life. Since she was a little girl, Carrie keeps visiting her father at the tennis courts where he coaches people for tournaments until she becomes one of his most important students, to be trained to be a beast who destroys her opponents!\\n\\nCarrie becomes callous, relentless, an ice queen, a battle-axe, focusing on winning. She even fires her own father to become the winner, working with another coach who helps her dreams come true!\\n\\nAnd in 1994, she’s 37, she’s single, her only friends and confidantes are her father Javi and her agent Gwen. Her records are about to be taken away by a brutal, competitive, 31-year-old brilliant tennis player Nicki Chan. Carrie cannot let that happen! Without being the best tennis player, who can she be? Nobody! She doesn’t have any love interest, and any aim in life makes her excited. She has to return back! She has to get back what belongs to her! She has to be the best of the best again!\\n\\nThis means she has to train more and work with the man she had a past with. The man’s name is Bowe Huntley, who is a struggling tennis player working so hard to get in shape after being sober, getting through divorce, and lots of game losses.\\n\\nCarrie has no intention of becoming friends with him. They tend to act civil and do their jobs for becoming the best!\\nBut at the age of 37, Carrie realizes her life, her goals can change. She slowly learns to open her heart to people by looking at a different perspective. Maybe becoming the best is subjective. Maybe she never exceeds her own expectations.\\n\\nI loved most of the characters! Javi is my star, and I’m taking a bow for sweetheart Bowe, who was caring, patient, and so lovable.\\n\\nI enjoyed the crossovers from \"Daisy Jones and the Six\" as Carrie reads the biography and dates Nina’s husband from \"Malibu Raising.\"\\n\\nIf you don’t like tennis, this book will make you a big fan by explaining the basic rules smartly. Each chapter keeps you on your toes, and you feel like you\\'ve been transported to the tennis matches, sitting on the benches to watch the games live with your heart in your throat! The narration couldn\\'t be more exciting! You jump up and down, scream, cross your fingers, and wish so hard to see Carrie win!\\n\\nOverall, I love sports and anything TJR writes.

       " \"It sends a tiny thrill through me . . . staring up at a mountain I have yet to scale, each match a step toward the top. It has been so long since I have felt the perfect ache of climbing.\\nI'm always drawn towards stories about overcoming adversity at great odds and achieving the impossible through sheer determination and hard work. So is it any surprise that this story totally grabbed ahold of me and refused to let go?\\n\\nCarrie Soto, the greatest player in tennis history, knows the joy and sacrifice of victory. Trained by her father since she was a toddler, she holds the record for the most Grand Slams to her name. But that achievement has come at great personal cost. When a new crop of upstarters threatens her legacy, she is left with no choice. Now she is coming out of retirement to defend her record, working with her father one last time to show herself and the world what she is capable of.\\n\\nWhat an absolutely captivating story this was. From the very first page, I was mesmerized both by the well-drawn characters as well as the compelling narrative. Yes, this is fiction, but it sure doesn't feel like it. Instead, it feels like a piece of real tennis history brought to life, and we the readers are there to witness it in all of its glory and heartache.\\n\\nOne aspect of this story that surprised me is that the character of Carrie Soto isn't altogether likable. She's brash, confident to the point of arrogance, and often rude to all who stands in her way. She isn't always in it for the love of the game; rather, she wants to win at all cost, even if the price is her own happiness. But it really speaks to Reid's strong storytelling abilities that such a character doesn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the book. In fact, Carrie's flaws make her portrayal and her eventual personal growth that much more compelling.\\n\\nThere is a lot of tennis in this book. And I absolutely lapped it up. Even as someone who doesn't play the game (though I do occasionally watch a match on tv), I found all the tennis jargon in here easy to follow. In fact, reading it reminds me of how riveting this game can be, and I was impressed with Reid's ability to capture not just the grueling physical aspects but also its mental facets as well.\\n\\nBut this book isn't just about competing and winning. In true Taylor Jenkins Reid fashion, it's bursting with heart and soul. It shines a stark spotlight on what it means to be human, to want to strive to be the best you can be, and to achieve whatever you set your heart to. It reminds us that hard work matters, and that age ain't nothing but a number. But it also shows that it's okay to fail, that letting go is sometimes the right thing to do, and that greatness isn't always measured by what everyone else says.\\n\\nCarrie's father compares her to Achilles, and that feels particularly apt. Achilles craved glory and greatness, and he worked hard towards it his whole life. He finally achieves all that he dreams of during the Trojan War, but it comes at a steep price. And so Carrie does too. She is a warrior of the highest caliber, training every moment of her life, for that one moment of glory so that she will go down in history.\\n\\nWhat a story! It's exciting and uplifting and inspirational, but it never loses sight of its heart. In fact, that is a hallmark of Taylor Jenkins Reid's recent books. And it shows that she is still a master of her craft, taking us on literary journeys so intimate and exhilarating, we can't help but feel they're real.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\",\n",
       " \"In my opinion, Taylor Jenkins Reid is back!!\\n\\nI know for a lot of people she never left, but after really loving a couple of her earlier books, I have been disappointed by Daisy Jones & The Six and Malibu Rising. The format in the former didn't work for me (I very much like to be immersed in a story) and I don't know what was going on in the latter but it didn't hold my attention.\\n\\nThis was -level riveting for me. I couldn't put it down.\\n\\nReid pulled me right inside the mind of Carrie Soto and right into each heart-pounding game of tennis. I am not a sports person, don't watch sports, but I was for the duration of this novel. The gruelling training, the ferocious competition, Carrie's to be the best and her fear that she might not be. The story of a young girl who sees other children building sandcastles and thinks:\\n\\nCarrie is not a likable sports personality, which, of course, made me like her even more. She doesn't play to fans, her mouth often runs away from her, and she's a sore loser. She can't help it. Raised by single father Javier, she has lived and breathed tennis her whole life. It is who she is and the thought that she might not be the best... well, it's unthinkable. When a younger player matches her all-time slam record, thirty-seven year old Carrie plans a comeback. At her age, it's not easy. Can it even be done?\\n\\nAs well as being a fabulously gripping story of ambition verging on obsession, it is also about being a woman in sports-- the sexism, the double standards, the focus on her likability (or in Carrie's case, lack of), the trivializing of her achievements by male tennis players. It's also a lovely story of the relationship between a woman and a father who is also her coach, cheerleader and number one fan.\\n\\nAt its heart, the book's message is a simple old one. One that could have been cheesy in the wrong hands, but Reid pummels our heart enough along the way that the message comes as a relief. It's this: everything is temporary and all good things come to an end. You can try to cling to it as long as possible, sucking every bit of life and enjoyment out of it, or you can love and appreciate every second while it is happening and, in the end, let it go.\",\n",

TJR makes no attempt to offer any translation or explain what was said. Readers who aren't fluent will be left clueless. Did I miss something important? Did TJR insert a hidden gem? I'll never know!\\n\\nAlso, this book is about TENNIS. Not tennis, but all CAPS. TENNIS. As in, the entire book to the point I threw in the towel, is about TENNIS. There is no drama. No mystery. No plot. There is just the history of a TENNIS career. So, unless you really LOVE TENNIS, you're going to get really bored, really fast.\\n\\nThat sounds really harsh, I know, but c'est la vie!

       " \"➸ 4.25 stars\\n“we live in a world where exceptional women have to sit around waiting for mediocre men”\\n\\n\\n➷ TJR never fails to amaze me with her writing style, i always become immersed in the story. all her books have been easy reads for me, i love how she writes realistic, emotionally complex characters and the relationships - it’s what TJR does incredibly well in my opinion, she knows how to write unforgettable characters! i find it compelling how unlikable and realistically flawed her FMCs often are, but i support women’s rights and i support women’s wrongs!! carrie is a tough character and she goes after what she wants with no remorse—because of her upbringing carrie has an extreme case of athletic perfectionism and we get to see the upsides and downsides of her competitiveness, but you can’t help but root for her as the book progresses.\\n\\n— there is a lot of commentary on how women are portrayed in the media and in sports. this was a great insight into how society treats women's successes, especially as they get older. i loved how TJR touched on the double standards when it comes to male vs female athletes - the power and prejudice of the media is strongly present in the book. the media coverage for carrie was quite sexist and derogatory, she is constantly called a “bitch” by male commentators for being confident and trash talking other players (she is a brutally honest person) but when you see male players do that they are always highly praised, it shows it’s only acceptable for men to do it but unforgivable for a woman.\\n\\n➷ one of the highlights of this book is the close father/daughter relationship between carrie and javier. yes he did push her too hard to become the best tennis player and sent her the message that winning was important - this causes her to have a sheltered childhood/life bc her world only revolved around becoming the worlds greatest tennis player. javier was one of my fav characters and you can’t help but feel sympathy for him bc he was at the lowest points in his life after losing his wife and coaching was his escape after being left with unbearable heartache. even though he was tough on carrie, he loved her with everything he had. he had good intentions and he only wanted what was best for her while also wanting to see her full potential bc he knows she had it in her. the trust, respect and close bond they have between each other was really admirable and heartwarming, it brought me back to when i was younger and my dad and i would always watch the Australian Open, he would take me out to play fun practice matches and taught me so many things about the game,, and to this day we still have that close bond - so it was really easy for me to connect to this book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n➳ carrie soto was the number one tennis player in her prime with the most grand slam wins - that is, until nicki chan ties it right in front of carrie's eyes, creating a spark in her. in a surprise decision she decides to come out of retirement to protect her title and reclaim her legacy. carrie was a realistic character and oftentimes unlikable, yet i still found her compelling. she was unapologetically herself, fierce, competitive, abrasive and does not take any shit from anyone and proudly owns the “bitch” title that was given to her. she knows she is talented and doesn’t need others to tell her, nor does she care whose feelings she hurts climbing to the top. we can see that she is a good person but she is closed off emotionally from others and has a hard time losing! i loved watching her character grow and become compassionate and understanding of others and that it’s okay to open up your heart and be vulnerable. i wish we got to see more of her relationship with bowe and friendship with nicki.\\n\\n\\n\\n➷ taylor jenkins reid is an absolute genius at writing stories that feels like real life and makes you forget that you’re reading fiction!! just like DJATS you feel like these characters are real people — i love how she creates a beautiful world with unique characters who have depth and i loved how the characters from her other books where subtly incorporated into the story. this was a real page turner, i laughed, i cried and it had me on the edge of my seat, the suspense was thrilling bc you’re constantly wondering .\\n\\n— this was a light, easy and engaging read but also pretty predictable. this story highlights the importance of never giving up and female ambition in a male-dominated sphere. i love the compelling characters and strong development. i was impressed with TJR’s knowledge of tennis and the ability to capture the excitement of watching a game.\",\n",

During the US Open, Carrie watches as Nicki Chan matches her record. Carrie wants to come out of retirement to reclaim her record. Will Carrie be able to affirm her place in tennis history?\\n\\nFirst of all, let’s talk about how TJR, Taylor Jenkins Reid, is such a great author. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising, and Daisy Jones and The Six, all great books. Carrie Soto is Back is also very readable with short sentences and paragraphs. The pages were flying by, and I found the book easy to read.\\n\\nSecond, there is some depth to this book as we sort through Carrie’s relationships and feelings. Carrie unapologetically talks about how she is the greatest tennis player of all time and how much she works for her success. And people don’t like her outspokenness.\\n\\nIt really reminded me of a YouTube video that I watched recently. The commentator said that back in the 90’s, when women were asked about their success, they would often times blush, giggle, and say how they were lucky. Only until recently have more women been able to say, “I got to where I am because of hard work.”\\n\\nI have also fallen into this trap before, thinking a person was successful because they were lucky. On International Women’s Day, my employer hired a wildly successful TV anchor to give us a pep talk. Like many people, I thought, “She’s just lucky.”\\n\\nHowever, the TV anchor passed her resume around, by hand, to hundreds of potential employers. Finally, one station allowed her to cover the traffic report. She spent her week driving around and covering potholes and traffic accidents. On night and weekends, she would wait at the station, ready to fill in for one of the TV anchors if there was a last-minute cancellation. It took her years to finally obtain her position.

I know nothing about tennis at all but this book had me SO invested in it. Carrie was a fascinating character and I felt like this book had a more satisfying ending than other TJR books I've read. I found there was a moment in the middle where I thought the story was dragging a bit and I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but it quickly picked up and took a turn. Also the audiobook, as per usual for TJR, was fantastic with a full cast and parts that sounded like an actual sports broadcast which was SO cool!!\",\n",

       " '\"Most assholes don’t have comebacks.”\\n\\n4.5 stars\\n\\nCarrie Soto Is Back is a novel about family, love, tennis, and the price of fame.\\n\\nThe novel opens in 1994 when former tennis star Carrie Soto witnesses seeing her record o 20 Grand Slam titles shattered. She comes out of retirement at age 37 and makes an arduous journey back to the court to prove that she is the best female tennis player in the world. Going back to her childhood, the reader also learns how she became known as the Battle Axe, a.k.a., The Bitch.\\n\\n\\n\\nis, in a way, a character study. The reader sees Carrie transform into a star but also lose her fame. Very slowly, her tough veneer slips away, and it is apparent that Carrie is much more vulnerable than she seems.\\n\\nThe novel moves a little slowly in the beginning and covers a lot of tennis, but the slow pacing picks up as Carrie’s career takes off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.',\n",
       " 'I think this is my favourite Taylor Jenkins Reid book so far, my love for her writing just grows with every single novel that I read.\\n\\nCarrie Soto is back follows the legendary tennis player, Carrie, as she returns to the tennis world in an attempt to save her record. But, after being retired for years has she got what it takes to make the come back she is aiming for?\\n\\nWhat a book this was! TJR manages to create such incredible and strong female leads in her books. I fall in love with the personal and unique power that every single one of them has. Carrie has a determination and motivation that I found incredibly inspiring. I loved the message of trying your best, having fun whilst doing it and excepting that it may not turn out like you hoped, but that is fine.\\n\\nThe tennis scenes in this sent me right back to my teen years when I used to play. Although you don’t need any knowledge of tennis to be able to follow what is happening. My only criticism was that the book frequently moved to Spanish without any translation. Luckily, I was reading on my kindle so I could translate it easily but this would be tricky with a physical book. Overall, this was a book that I did not want to put down, but it had a beautiful simplicity to it as well. At one point, I became incredibly emotional and actually couldn’t read on, it hit a raw spot for me but was handled so well.\\n\\nI recommend this book to any fans of Taylor Jenkins Reid or those who love a strong female lead in their books! I want to thank Netgalley, Random House UK, Cornerstone and Taylor Jenkins Reid for sending me a copy of this book so I could give my personal thoughts.',\n",
       " 'Taylor Jenkins Reid, as usual, managed to write a stunning book that will win the hearts of the readers.\\n\\nShe chose to discuss the world of tennis through the life of Carrie Soto in this book.\\n\\nCarrie is a true champion who holds the current world record for the most number of grand slams. She retired from the game six years ago. It is the 90s now, and a fierce, stunning player named Nicki Chan is on the verge of breaking her record.\\n\\nCarrie decides to come back from retirement at the age of thirty-seven years to reclaim her record. Her father coaches her. Will Nicki Chan be able to beat the all-time best player? Has Carrie lost her mojo, as few of the sports pundits are criticizing? TJR will give the answers to all these questions through this book.\\n\\nThis book is a true treat for tennis lovers. I love the game of tennis and have watched many marathon matches played between players like Daria Saville and Emma Raducanu in women\\'s tennis and between Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal in men\\'s tennis. . I think that is a stupendous achievement by the author. She tells even the intricate details about the game so that a novice to the world of tennis also can enjoy this book.\\n\\nThe world of woman\\'s Tennis has seen some extraordinary comebacks. My favorite has always been that of the legend, Martina Navratilova. Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, and Kim Clijsters also made some amazing comebacks. Many of the details written by the author about Carrie reminded me of and , as I was lucky enough to watch them play on live tv.\\n\\nThis is not just a sports book. There are more layers hidden inside it. It is a story of true love between a father and his daughter. Their bond reminded me of the amazing bond between and his daughters and , who are true legends in the game of tennis. At one point in the novel, I felt deja vu when I read the conversation between Carrie and her father. It reminded me of the words of about her father, , and the amazing bond they shared between them. She once said,\" My father Yuri believes in miracles, and so do I.\" This book also shows the battle of egos between the players and the race for winning grand slams and breaking records.\\n\\nThe author could have been easily carried away while writing this book and could have written it in a cinematic way by adding all the popular elements that readers crave. But she decided to take a different route. She took a realistic approach to the narration. Moreover, she also chose to discuss many important topics like sexism, body shaming, and many other issues affecting the game of tennis.\\n\\n\\n\\nTennis might be sadly one of those sports where women have faced sexism at the highest level for the last few decades. The match between Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams shocked many true tennis lovers. Few of the rules and dress codes of women\\'s tennis have been a topic of discussion for some time now. The author invites our attention to a few of the sexist problems that tennis is facing now.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is said that When we are playing tennis or any other game, the most important quality we should have is the enthusiasm and the attitude to enjoy our game. That will be only present when we are playing to win. If we are playing not to lose, we are playing from a position of weakness. The author has done an amazing job in making us understand this vital lesson through this novel.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe author tells us the best way to deal with the crowds through Carrie\\'s character in this book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe author chose to make Carrie’s character with many imperfections, and her character arc is deliberately created in an imperfect way even though she is a world champion to make the novel more realistic. I loved how the author decided to raise her voice against sexism through her characters. Still, I wouldn\\'t say I liked a few of the statements told by Carrie. I will share one quote told by Carrie here.\\n\\nI didn\\'t expect such a statement from Carrie\\'s character. We can try to substantiate by telling about the time period when this story is happening. But this book was published in August 2022, and the author should have been a little more careful about such statements coming from the protagonist, especially in a novel written in such a progressive and realistic way. But this is just a minor mistake I found in this book, and I know I am picking needles in a haystack here. The author wrote the rest of the novel in a perfect way.\\n\\n\\nThe topics Taylor selects to write for each novel are all entirely different, and every time she convincingly wins the heart of the readers who are fans of those specific topics. I think that is the true quality of a great writer, and I am sure we will see many more amazing books from her.',\n",

Specifically tennis\\n✔️Powerful yet flawed FMC\\n✔️Family centred relationships\\n\\nCarrie Soto is an athelete who aims to be the greatest tennis player in the world. To achieve that goal, there a lot of hindrances in her way, one of it being her own self. Will she be able to be the GOAT? What will it cost her?\\n\\nI'll admit Carrie was not the most easy person to like. Her attitude in the beginning was not appreciated by me much. But overtime, as I read through her struggles, hard work and ambition- it became so easy to root for her. To see her become the person she wanted to be. To finally enjoy the sport she used to love. This is a journey you don't wanna miss.\\n\\nIt might feel a bit slow at times, especially the transcripts but it's so worth it. The ending was so satisfying.\\n\\nI also found out later that there are some references to Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising and Daisy Jones and the six. I had not read any of those books, this is my first TJR book and reading it as a standalone worked for me. Obviously, I didn't get any of those references but hey, it was a beautiful journey.

       " '\"Everything we achieve is ephemeral. We have it, and then the next second it\\'s gone.\"\\n\\n°•*⁀➷\\n\\nIf you\\'ve read any of my reviews on my 5 star books, you\\'ll probably see \"sometimes you read a book, and sometimes it reads you\" written into all of my favorites. I believe that with my whole heart. I believe there is a force in the universe that puts things in your life when you need them, and you get to choose what to do with the new path than opens up because of it.\\n\\nThis book feels more than that. It feels like it was written for me. I actually had a conversation with a friend recently about how we find things we love and then later, sometimes years later, we realize we loved that thing so much because it was a part of us we weren\\'t ready to accept yet. The reason this feels is because I\\'ve been constantly learning how exhausting expectations are since I started therapy in 2019. That journey has been long, and hard, and will be something I travel through for the rest of my life... and to see that so eloquently written into a book. I truly don\\'t have enough words to thank authors for the visibility, strength and ownership they give us readers.\\n\\nThere were so many quotes I could have used as the base, but this one felt the most true. I think ephemeral might be my new favorite word. This is a comeback story. A story about celebrity. A story about a father and a daughter. About expectation, self-reflection, acceptance, joy, respect, life, love, forgiveness and so many other very human experiences. Everyone can find something to relate to: guaranteed. It\\'s about recognizing all of those things and knowing that no matter how many records you have, there will always be someone to come along and make new ones.\\n\\nWhen we met Carrie Soto in it was easy to see her as the other woman and not worry about her outside of that simple fact. I love that TJR has decided to make her own little reality within our own, and wrote a story that\\'s all Carrie\\'s. Because there are always two sides to a story, and now that I\\'ve read Carrie\\'s, I\\'ll never think of her as the other woman again. She knew what she was doing, and she hated herself for it, and because of that I can\\'t find it in me to hate her, too.\\n\\nFrom that moment, I listened differently. I heard her father\\'s motivation and heard is as she did: an expectation to win. To only win. To be the best. To never let anyone else be better. My heart broke every time she needed to be more. Every time the transcripts written in the story told her she wasn\\'t enough no matter how many records she set. Every time we saw what people thought of her versus who we see she is.\\n\\nThe first time she realizes that her love for tennis is the only thing that matters... I cried. I cried a lot, honestly. Because while this book is about tennis, about being the best and wanting to remain the best... it\\'s more so about realizing you can\\'t be number one forever, and accepting that. It\\'s a journey we all take with ourselves constantly. Or, it\\'s one we should take constantly.\\n\\nI could probably go on forever. I could quote so many things and explain their meaning to me. I could write about celebrity vs expectation vs self. I\\'m a writer, a book lover, and a huge advocate for loving what you have and knowing what you deserve. But what this review boils down to is that you are the master of yourself.\\n\\nYou get to choose to accept who you are or fight to be someone different.\\n\\nThe expectation set on your shoulders is a suggestion, not a guide on how to live your life.\\n\\nI hope that when (if) you pick this up, you recognize those things about Carrie. I hope that as you experience her journey, you see some of your own. Maybe you aren\\'t ready to climb your mountain yet, but in this you see that one day you will. Maybe you\\'re ready and you need to hear that, \"You are perfect, even in your imperfection.\"\\n\\nMaybe you\\'re in the middle of your climb and you need to hear, \"You don\\'t need to show them. You just need to be.\"\\n\\nMaybe you\\'re at the top, and you need to hear, \"I am not proud, as much as I am grateful.\"\\n\\nMaybe you\\'re realizing there\\'s another mountain, because there always will be, and you need to hear, \"I have always known there is no mountain you cannot climb, one step at a time.\"\\n\\nWhatever it is, pick this up and find your path. Fall in love with Carrie Soto, \"the warrior, the king\", the maker of her own destiny. And maybe find the start of your own.\\n\\n- Paige',\n",

Now available as of 8.30!**\\n\\n\"People act like you can forget your own name, but if you\\'re not paying attention, you can veer so incredibly far away from everything you know about yourself to the point where you stop recognizing what they call you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCarrie ‘Carolina\\' Soto grew up dealing with heartbreak, the sort of pain that can turn into fuel if you can learn how to channel it. After losing her mother at an early age, she learned the ways of the racket from her coach (and father) Javier...and also learned that failure was NOT an option.\\n\\nShe also then decides that she was going to be the best. EVERYONE will know her name. And like her or not, she\\'s going to\\n\\n20 Grand Slam wins later...she\\'s racked up titles, fame, and acclaim...but has also been named \"The Battle Axe.\" Reputation aside, Carrie doesn\\'t let the judgments stop her and chooses to retire on this high note. She\\'s content with her choice...until newcomer Nicki Chan starts to claim her turf as new champ, and Carrie isn\\'t having it. Poised for a comeback, she decides to come out of retirement and REMIND everyone who she is and that she hasn\\'t gone for good. But in this new landscape with younger, faster players challenging her body, emotional conflicts and family troubles troubling her heart, and the critics and naysayers plaguing her thoughts, will her bravada hold up?\\n\\nWhen I heard this book featured Carrie Soto from Malibu Rising, I was a bit surprised she was going to get her own book and also nervous that I wouldn\\'t be a huge fan of this book. I thought this was going to be a sort of complement to that book, and I was a bit baffled as to why one would be needed. I had an especially hard time connecting with the characters in Malibu Rising, for whatever reason, and truly appreciated the time period the story was set in more than anything else. , TJR herself is \\'back\\' in this one, with fully fleshed out characters who jump right off the page (whether it\\'s their serve or not!) and plenty of emotional push and pull to keep the reader invested.\\n\\nShe\\'s the type not to hold back, and I appreciated the honesty of her character, so driven by the need to win that little else matters. What TJR does so well in Carrie Soto is to give a voice and a heart to the conflict that I\\'m sure so many athletes struggle with on a daily basis: how much of my competitive nature is inherently ME and why do I have a compulsive to win? My husband is incredibly competitive in his gaming, and while it\\'s not something I relate to personally, it was so interesting to peel back the curtain on why Carrie might feel this way and if her competitive nature informs her character...or vice versa.\\n\\nThis was a lot less on the historical fiction side of things than some of Reid\\'s other books, which to me which somewhat sad since I love looking for all the references she always includes in her books. Most of the novel also takes place in the 80s and 90s and since I grew up during this time, I was hanging on every reference...I just wish there had been more! I do love that TJR always manages to weave in different stylistic bits in her prose, from news articles to interviews, and makes everything feel , you often forget that her characters aren\\'t real. (There\\'s also a tiny nod to Daisy Jones that made me smile!)\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve always been somewhat of a casual fan, so I was worried so much detail about the game would get boring or repetitive (or whiz over my head like a very fast serve) but luckily Reid always knows how to keep things moving and I didn\\'t feel it was too bogged down with extraneous details. Fair warning, there is a good amount of Spanish spoken between Carrie and her father: some of it is easy to figure out through context clues, but I found myself looking up words from time to time.\\n\\nPerhaps you think you already know the end to Carrie\\'s story before you begin...but when it comes to endings themselves? Through her character Gwen, Reid serves up a PERFECT outlook:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n🎾\\n\\n4 stars',\n",
       " '4 Stars\\n\\nI picked this up for the same reasons everyone else did...because it\\'s Taylor Jenkins Reid and I\\'ll read anything she puts out.\\n\\nThat said, I read the blurb and that\\'s it. So, I had completely forgotten that the title character was even IN Malibu Rising, let alone her role in it. I don\\'t think it would have made a difference to me either way, as I enjoy books about hated characters, but still...I\\'m glad I didn\\'t remember who Carrie was until about 25% in because it really allowed me to absorb Carrie independently of anything else.\\n\\nNow, I was not a tennis player and I never played to the level Carrie did, obviously. However, I WAS a collegiate scholarship athlete who spent the majority of age 5-21 on a sports field with a VERY dedicated and involved father. As a result, I felt VERY connected to Carrie...her competitive nature...her perfectionism...and her fear of failure.\\n\\nI also really enjoyed the relationship she has with her father. In my mind, that was the true love story here. Not her relationship to tennis, not her relationship to the love interest...but her and Javier. I thought the unfolding of events leading up to the US Open was very touching and the way the last tournament and Javier\\'s \"feedback\" was layered throughout was brilliant. I also thought the ending was both inspirational AND realistic.\\n\\nAll that said, this book quite bogged down with a lot of tennis jargon, tennis strategy...just tennis PERIOD. While that wasn\\'t an issue for me (in fact, I quite enjoyed it), I could see it being an issue for some readers.\\n\\nAll in all, after not really loving I was excited that this one was a hit for me.',\n",

       " \"Carrie Soto Is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid\\nNarrated by Stacy Gonzalez and others\\n\\nI followed tennis closely back in the days that fictional Carrie Soto competed. Still, when the story started, I thought the tennis talk might be too much for me, too boring. But once I got accustomed to it, I enjoyed the talk, the practice, the coaching, and the games. I especially enjoyed the parts of the book with various narrators giving commentary and opinions about Carrie and other players. Very gossipy!\\n\\nCarrie had been the best but had retired in 1988. Then in 1994, at the age of 37, Carrie decides to come out of retirement as another top player is about to shatter a record that is most dear to her. Carrie's father is behind her decision, he's glad to coach her again so they set to work, focusing just on the four Slam tournaments. There is a lot at stake, including endorsements and money, since Carrie can only make her value as a legend fall if she fails in her comeback attempt. But money isn't what Carrie cares about, she has more than she needs for herself and her charity. It's her ego that is driving her to come out of retirement. Carrie's training partner will be an old flame, Bowe Huntley, a men's player who wants his last year to be his best year.\\n\\nThere is almost nothing I liked about Carrie but I understand that in the sports world, like other worlds, being best has nothing to do with being liked or being a nice person. Carrie is single minded again, focused only on winning another Slam or two. She'll mow down anyone in her way and if she fails to do so she'll rage at herself mercilessly. Winning is everything. Carrie's coach father is one of my favorite characters in this story but I lost much of what he was saying because he spoke so much Spanish that wasn't translated. Bowe was another favorite of mine, with a pretty amazing attitude after years on the circuit as the bad boy of tennis.\\n\\nPublished August 30th 2022 by Random House Audio\",\n",
       " 'mixed feelings but mostly a positive experience?\\n\\nbiggest thing for me is that the whole ~takeaway message~ thing that TJR always goes for in her books is less obvious in this one. i feel like i haven\\'t taken a frying pan of \"THIS IS THE POINT\" to the dome this time and i really appreciate that.\\n\\nbut i am noticing that in the past few books that TJR has published she likes to play with timeline in a way that i don\\'t think works. if i were to point out something i think she excels at, it\\'s getting you to care about her characters. love em or hate em, they tend to have nuanced personalities. but the all over the place timeline thing takes away from that. in this book you\\'re thrown into the mid life of carrie and then shown what her goal is: to make a comeback to tennis. great. but why the fuck do i care? we get maybe a couple of chapters showing us her past and how she initially got into tennis. but it wasn\\'t enough to build a sense of \"wow i\\'m rooting for this woman.\"\\n\\nwhile i think the takeaway here wasn\\'t so in your face, it did feel like the only part of the book that mattered. half baked romance, relationship with coach/dad, carrie\\'s reputation in the media... all things that could have been explored deeply. but weren\\'t. just so we could watch this process of carrie slowly losing her ego.\\n\\nallllll of that complaining aside. so if TJR is gonna get me to care about something, it\\'s gonna happen here. and i think it kind of worked. sure it wasn\\'t groundbreaking stuff but i like reading about people kicking ass in really hard circumstances. i liked carrie grappling with her ego. it was relatable seeing her reactions to her competitors. it was a pretty pleasurable listening experience.\\n\\ncould i have gone my whole life without picking up another TJR book? yeah. but duty calls and says i have to read this lady\\'s entire backlist.',\n",

Why can’t we have a woman who is a brilliant chemist but isn’t naive, socially awkward, and clueless? Except when she’s not, usually in time to deliver another monologue.\\n\\n- the MC’s daughter is a genius who knew the periodic table as a preschooler and reads the Sound and the Fury at age 8. Of course she is. Very relatable.\\n\\n- Elizabeth’s views and actions were not consistent with the era. It’s as if a woman from 2022 time traveled back to the 1950s and then lectured everyone with lengthy monologues on social issues and women’s rights. I don’t need a lecture and I don’t need to be repeatedly hit over the head on relevant social issues. This book needed more showing, less telling.\\n\\n- the message is a worthy one. A woman ahead of her time in STEM who must fight the status quo in a male dominated world. But I think the message would have been stronger and more authentic if it had been realistic. There’s a lot of exaggeration and preposterous situations to drive a point home, which is not my favorite storytelling technique.\\n\\n- all the men, with one exception, were ugly and hateful misogynists. I’m weary of male-bashing in fiction.\\n\\n- Did I need to read details of a man who masturbates and flings pubic hairs across the room, leaving behind his sticky porn magazines for his wife to clean up? No I did not 🤮\\n\\n- Atheism vs Faith. The author mentions multiple times that this is a free country and we have a right to our beliefs. I 100% agree. But she apparently believes only atheists have a right to their beliefs. I’m no bible thumping extremist, but it’s offensive when religion and people of faith are portrayed only in derogatory terms, such as faith is “a simpleton’s recipe for prayers and beads” and a funeral service was “boring verse and preposterous prayers”. A minister muses that the problem with his job “was how many times he had to lie”. The ministers and priests were all child abusers, liars, and greedy crooks. Lay people of faith were all violent protestors and/or morons. The message repeatedly driven home throughout the book, ad nauseam? Atheism = good People of faith = bad.\\n\\nBelieve me, if the author had portrayed atheists as all bad I would find it equally as offensive.\\n\\n- I’m weary of the argument of science vs religion. Sure there are extremists who deny science but the majority of people and religions do not believe they are mutually exclusive. There are plenty of religious scientists. Sigh….\\n\\n- Anachronisms. Subsidized child care in Sweden wasn’t enacted until 1975, although the MC refers to it in 1960. And was defunding the police a thing in the early 1950s? I think not.\\n\\n- certainly women have been, and are, discriminated against. I’m not denying that bias occurs but the exaggeration and preposterous events in the story hinders the message. I have a science degree. I took many college courses in STEM. I worked in a male dominated work culture. In this book every single man in a power position was a misogynist. Not realistic. Please stop it..\\n\\n- Also, we are given information at the end that suggests there was a valid reason Elizabeth wasn’t accepted in the doctoral program, that had nothing to do with her gender or an incident that happened early in the book. This confused me?! What was the message? 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️\\n\\nNo book is without merit. The positives:\\n\\n- I am not usually a fan of anthropomorphism but I loved the dog, Six-Thirty. By far he was my favorite character. And yay, he survives! 😍\\n\\n- the cooking show was cute',\n",
       " 'I gave all of my votes to this book, both for the best debut and historical fiction categories, at the Goodreads Choice Awards. I\\'m thrilled to find out that Barnes & Noble has chosen this brilliant work as the book of the year - it is highly deserved!\\n\\nAmazing news, my friends! This fantastic book has been adapted into a streaming series on Apple TV, starring Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott and an outstanding cast crew including Lewis Pullman, Beau Bridges, Ana Naomi King, Kevin Sussman, Thomas Mann, Stephanie Koenig, and Patrick Walker. I cannot wait to binge-watch it!\\n\\nOkay, folks, I just finished the best book of 2022! Now I can relax knowing that I don\\'t need to search for something better. No, wait, I lied. Not about finding the best book - this one is freaking amazing - but I will continue to search for exemplary fictions like this that can speak to my heart and soul at the same time! I give it five gazillion stars!\\n\\nI loved the author\\'s extra-intelligent, dark, original sense of humor, and I fell in love with her characters. The story of Elizabeth brought out so many complex feelings: I laughed, I got angry, I cried, I sighed, I laughed again, and as soon as I finished the last chapter, I gave my ovation! This is an underrated secret gem! Don\\'t you dare skip this book or let it sit in your TBR pile. Just read it!\\n\\nLet me give you a summary of the plot and introduce you to the characters:\\n\\nElizabeth Zott: How can I express my feelings about this character? She\\'s so unique, different, extraordinary, visionary, extremely quirky, odd, straightforward, honest, a real feminist, intelligent, intellectual, fighter, survivor, and a brilliant scientist who is brave enough to fight for her rights and her loved ones against mansplaining, inequality, abuse, and humiliation!\\n\\nIn 1960, after her traumatic experience at UCLA, she starts working at the Hastings Research Institute, which is administered with a male workforce that ignores her enthusiasm and hard work. Only one person sees her and shows respect for her accomplishments: an aspiring, Nobel Prize-nominated, grudge-holder named Calvin Evans.\\n\\nThe first time they met, he thought she was a secretary, and the second time they met, he vomited on her. There is nothing ordinary about their love story. They are soul mates. They are great minds alike. They are the quirkiest, most unconventional couple. They row together. They adopt the ugliest and most loyal, incredible dog and name him Six-Thirty. They were happy, even though Elizabeth rejected marrying him because she wanted to become an independent scientist without being acknowledged for her husband\\'s contributions.\\nBut then...\\n\\nWe fast-forward to see Elizabeth building a new life, raising her four-year-old, extra-smart, one-of-a-kind, sweetest girl named Mad Zott, helping their dog Six-Thirty improve his vocabulary skills, and most importantly, she\\'s a TV star now! She teaches women to use chemistry not only in their kitchen but in their entire life to embrace change and challenges. She hosts the most eccentric cooking show called \"Supper at Six.\"\\n\\nHer blunt and honest comments about marriage, religion, and society\\'s norms will be considered rebellious and unconventional.\\n\\nElizabeth is not alone. She has a 55-year-old, devoted neighbor named Harriet Sloane, who truly detests her husband. She has her supporting producer, Walter Pine, who believed in her enough to give her a chance on TV while raising his daughter by himself. Dr. Mason likes to row with her, stopping by to wash her dishes and check her out.\\n\\nBut Mad thinks her mother is unhappy, and her homework to create a family tree pushes her to search for more information about her father\\'s past. She has no idea that her search will uncover many long-kept secrets.\\nOverall, this is the best book I have read lately! I fell in love with everything about this story and highly, extremely, and absolutely recommend it.',\n",
       " \"This book is mind-numbingly bad. I really do not see what everybody writing rave reviews are seeing. So, I'm a chemist and this main character is exactly the type of chemist that we make fun of - a pretentious snob that non-ironically calls household items by their scientific name and inserts their scientific knowledge into any conversation they have to assert how intelligent they are. There's a part where she criticizes a can of soup for having 'chemicals' in it, even though a chemist should know all food that exists is made of chemicals - that is literally how the world works, so on top of being an arrogant snot she is also an incorrect arrogant snot on multiple occasions.\\n\\nAnother point I'd like to bring up as a chemist, Elizabeth Zott apparently has several PhDs worth of knowledge, on degrees that she didn't even do. Her passion apparently is abiogenesis, to which actual scientists dedicate their entire academic careers solely, yet she also knows food science (an entirely different course of study) and can also teach herself how to row solely by reading physics textbooks (another entirely different course of study). It must be where her ridiculous daughter got her ridiculous genes from - she enthusiastically reads Norman Mailer and Vladimir Nabokov at age 4. I mean, didn't we all? She also debates religion with a reverend, who converts to atheism. Again, relatable pre-school experiences we all experienced.\\n\\nI'm also fairly sick of women putting down other women in all aspects of life, and this is no exception. Almost every other woman in this story is presented as catty, conniving and simple-minded (because they all believe in God, which this book hammers in that only total airheads do) except for our main character because she's not like the other girls. She wears pants and talks about how Sweden has subsidized childcare (which didn't even exist in 1960 yet so I guess the author phoned in on the whole research aspect). There is also no mention of any characters of color in this story, but that doesn't stop the author from comparing being a housewife to SLAVERY and including the daughter reading about the Congo cannibals to other-ize people of African descent. Bear in mind, that this is marketed as a comedy book. So ha ha. Every male character is also a chauvinistic pig with no redeeming qualities, also always hysterical.\\n\\nI didn't even touch on the most offensive part of this novel. TW: the beginning features a graphic r*pe scene, so good thing they didn't bother including a content warning. 'A novel that sparks joy on every page' claims the dust jacket, I claim bullsh*t.\\n\\nIn summary, there are no redeeming qualities about this book, except maybe that there was a dog in it.\",\n",
       " \"Imagine if all men took women seriously . . .\\nWhen you come across that perfect read, at what point do you realize? For me, it was from the very first page of Lessons in Chemistry.\\n\\nHonestly, who does Bonnie Garmus think she is, coming in here and writing a book that completely speaks to me? And on top of that, it's her debut. Well, just knock me over with a feather too while you're at it, why don't you!\\n\\nElizabeth Zott is a chemist in the 1960s. The problem is, she is the only one who views herself that way. Her male colleagues cannot get past the fact that she's a woman, and treat her more as a secretary and doormat, acknowledging her only long enough to steal her work. That is, until Calvin Evans, another brilliant chemist, comes along and really sees all that she is capable of. But life is unexpected, and so a few years later, Elizabeth is somehow the host of a cooking show. But in her heart, she still desires to be truly seen as a chemist.\\n\\nYou guys know how much I love strong female characters, and Elizabeth Zott is all that and more. She's fearless in the face of adversity, she stays true to herself, and she never lets others intimidate her into being less than all she can be. In other words, she is my hero.\\n\\nIt's not just Elizabeth who warms my heart. This story has the most wonderful collection of supporting characters. They add so much color and spirit to the whole thing. I wanted to hug them all. And if you're an animal lover of any sort, just be ready to have your heart burst into a million ooey gooey pieces. In fact, Six-Thirty might just be my favorite literary dog of all time.\\n\\nThe writing is so witty and brilliant. There's a zing to it that makes it feel zippy and wholly original. I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't put it down. Usually I can't wait to reach the end of a book so I can check it off my long TBR and move onto the next. But I wanted this to go and go and never end. I tried to savor every moment, but I ended up devouring it.\\n\\nWhat an absolute delight this was, from the very first moment to the last. It possesses all the hallmarks of the very best stories. It made me laugh, feel, think, and wonder. It filled me with joy and buoyed my spirits. It gave me everything I wanted and everything I didn't even know to ask for.\\n\\nSo many books come and go that often a true gem ends up buried in the deluge. Please don't let this one pass you by. Go read it. You'll be glad you did.\",\n",

       " 'Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus\\n\\nIt\\'s the early 60s and chemist Elizabeth Zott is causing her usual ruckus at Hastings Research Institute. For one thing, she can\\'t be a real chemist for the simple fact that she\\'s a woman. Also, she won\\'t make copies, get coffee, or do any of the other woman\\'s work at the institute, and she\\'s so cold and prickly she doesn\\'t want to be touched or groped and isn\\'t willing to provide \"favors\". Those are the reasons the men don\\'t like Elizabeth. The women don\\'t like her because she\\'s attractive, she turns the heads of the men, and she doesn\\'t know her place as a woman in a man\\'s world.\\n\\nAlso working at Hastings is Calvin Evans, a brilliant Noble prize nominee who has his very own massive lab where he can do who knows what and win more accolades. No one likes him either. Neither Calvin or Elizabeth care if anyone likes them, they just want to be left alone to do their jobs. But one day Elizabeth needs beakers and she knows Calvin has beakers so she barges into his lab and takes some. It\\'s not love at first sight but it\\'s pretty close and soon Elizabeth and Calvin are a very happy couple to the disdain of everyone who wishes them misery and failure.\\n\\nElizabeth and Calvin even get a dog and name him Six-thirty. Then fate intervenes and Elizabeth and Six-thirty are on their own until baby Mad is born. Elizabeth never wanted children and she certainly never wanted to be a single mother. Elizabeth never wanted to be famous for a cooking show that she gets wrangled into hosting, either, but when money is tight, something has to give and now Elizabeth is fighting with her cooking show bosses rather than her Hastings Research Institute bosses. Elizabeth is famous for all the wrong reasons (according to her bosses) while the women who are glued to her show five days a week are seeing all the opportunities they never knew they had, to be more than housewives and mothers.\\n\\nThis is a very funny story, with Six-thirty and Mad winning my heart immediately. It took a lot longer for me to warm up to Elizabeth but I finally did towards the end of the story. Life isn\\'t fair, in fact, it\\'s so unfair as to be criminal, and Elizabeth isn\\'t sure how long she can go slogging along, not doing what she wants to do, which is important research as a chemist. There are a lot of really good side characters, a lot of really horrible side characters, and always, there is Calvin, locked away in Elizabeth\\'s heart and dreams. I did have some issues with the story but overall it is humorous, clever, and allows Elizabeth to shine in all her intelligent glory. Even an afternoon cooking show can\\'t hold her down or make her bend to what she doesn\\'t believe.\\n\\nPub: April 5th 2022\\n\\nThank you to Doubleday Books and NetGalley for this ARC.',\n",
       " \"(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)\\n\\nI had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s teaches the housewives of America uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.\\n\\nSo this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.\\n\\nThis all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!\\n\\nSo this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!\\n\\nBut there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.\\n\\nI'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.\\n\\nP.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!\",\n",
       " 'I don’t think anything I can say will do this book justice. I love it from beginning to end and it will most certainly be in my top five reads of 2021.\\n\\nIt’s November 1961 and chemist Elizabeth Zott, who works at the Hastings Institute, has fallen into a TV role hosting ‘Supper at Six’ and has become an unlikely star in the ascendant. Cooking is chemistry, chemistry is life. Elizabeth is far from your average ‘60’s woman. For a start she’s a single mother to Mad Zott, shock, horror, especially to Mad’s odious teacher. Have I mentioned the dog, Six-Thirty? A divine canine, a failed bomb detection dog of remarkable emotional intelligence. Ten years earlier, same Institute, Calvin Evans, introvert, grudge holder, a genius, an exceptionally good rower and desperate to find a girlfriend meets Elizabeth Zott, also a grudge holder especially against the patriarchy. Chemistry in every sense of the word.\\n\\nOk, here goes. It’s inspiring, heartwarming, sad, joyous, intelligent, funny, witty, quirky, original,highly entertaining, life affirmingly brilliant and genius in my opinion! It captures the times, the patronising way women are treated ( can you see my lip curl and a developing snarl?) the assumptions, the blatant sexism and way worse which shocks you to the core even though you know it’s all true. She uses chemistry to reveal the dangers of a lob sided society which is completely one sided and to demonstrate the false limits on the potential of 50% of the population. It’s so cleverly done and I’m a science dunce but it made sense to me! The dialogue is excellent, at times it’s laugh out loud funny as it’s so well phrased or the mastery of a put down or understatement. Elizabeth is quite simply fabulous, I love her and want to be her but I’ll certainly need to mug up on the chemistry! Equally amazing is Mad and yes, let’s go back to the dog. As a massive dog lover to have Six-Thirty as a character in his own right is admirable and it works so well. I adore him and want to adopt him. The relationships are excellent too, some are a meeting of minds or to nurture, of love and admiration, of kinship and some are of professional jealousy or sabotage.\\n\\nOverall, you’ll have gathered that I think this debut is amazing and I urge you to read it. It has every ingredient of a book that fascinates, delights, charms and engages. If for nothing else read it for Six-Thirty ... and to find his out he gets his name cos I’m not saying!!\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially huge thanks to Random House UK, Transworld Doubleday for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.',\n",

       " '2.5 stars rounded up to 3. I have seen mostly all rave reviews from my friends on this one and thought I was going to love it too. I definitely had high hopes going into this book. For me personally, it was unfortunately just okay. It seemed to drag on and just wasn’t as interesting of a storyline as I hoped. I didn’t feel any real excitement reading it but I was happy with the ending. It’s readable and not a horrible book, just not for me.',\n",
       " \"Set in the 1950s and 1960s, Bonnie Garmus's offbeat comedic historical debut is a joyous and vibrant delight that will wrap its tentacles around your heart with its central protagonist, single mother and research scientist, the smart and beautiful Elizabeth Zott, whose passion for science has her seeing the world and people through the lens of Chemistry. Unfortunately for her, she lives in a time where it is believed that women have no place in science, it's a world where men dominate, control, exploit, patronise and silence women, sexually harrassing, lying, cheating and stealing her research, publishing and passing it off as their own. It doesn't stop there, men feel they can sexually assault a woman, and it will be the woman who pays the price, Elizabeth is forced to leave, unable to complete her PhD, with the police expecting her to 'regret' her behaviour, such are the rage inducing social norms and attitudes of the time.\\n\\nHowever, Elizabeth is no ordinary woman, she refuses to pander to fragile male egos, it worries her not one whit that she doesn't fit in at the patriarchal Hastings Institute, she accepts no limitations for herself, nor for anyone else. The chemistry between her and the star scientist, Calvin Evans, another man who does not fit either, leads to love, the two of them living together, Zott does not believe in marriage, and their religion is science. Circumstances result in Zott becoming a single mother to the precociously bright 4 year old, Mad, an early reader, voraciously consuming the likes of Norman Mailer and Charles Dickens. The challenges Zott faces, such as being fired for being pregnant and her dire financial circumstances has her becoming an unlikely, reluctant and uncompromising star, dressed in a lab coat, with her popular TV cooking show, Supper at Six, focusing on the chemistry of ingredients and recipes, carrying her subversive and radical agenda of making women question and challenge the cultural misogyny and the limitations placed on their lives. Needless to say, this makes her some implacable enemies.\\n\\nWhat makes the strong and independent Zott able to face the unrelenting harsh pressures and problems that come her way are her close knit and growing family, at the centre of which is their protective genius dog no-one will be able to resist, Six-thirty, familiar with more than 600 words, neighbour Harriet Sloane, rower Dr Mason, her TV producer, Walter Pine, and the Reverend Wakely, perhaps we can include Miss Frask too. This is a remarkable, hilarious and unforgettable debut from Garmus, outrageously entertaining, with oodles of charm, and I have no doubt that this will be a runaway success on publication. Do yourself a favour and read this brilliant novel. Highly recommended! Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.\",\n",
       " \"Every single person I know needs to read this book. Not every woman.. every person.\\n\\nAn insightful, part tear-jerker, truly hilarious at times work with more than enough charisma to make you want to be the best version of yourself? That is Bonnie Garmus’s masterpiece: Lessons In Chemistry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth Zott is growing up… the only thing she knows for certain is that she likes science. During the 1960s, while she was working at the Hastings Institute on groundbreaking research in abiogenesis – gender equality was nonexistent (even among scientists who should know better.) Life takes her through unexpected turns into falling in love with her co-worker Calvin Evans. Years later, as a single mother, Elizabeth finds herself the star of a live cooking show: Supper at Six. With her… unique… approach to cooking and can-do-attitude… Elizabeth finds herself teaching women more than to cook. She’s teaching them to value themselves and change the world.\\n\\n\\nThis is one of those books that reminds us we can absolutely do anything we put our minds to, even in the face of challenging circumstances. So much of Elizabeth’s character revolves around building herself up and building up the women around her.. she somewhat reminds me of Jessica Chastain’s character in The Help? (Another incredible book/movie adaptation!) She doesn’t care that society’s expectations of her dictate a certain kind of life. The book’s take on what women really go through in the most thankless job in the world: motherhood and ‘keeping house’ are insights that we all truly need!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo far this book is really amazing at about 40% of the way in. I'm really really loving it -- but then I also felt that way about Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow so we shall see.\\n\\nNOTES:\\n- Women's Literature\\n- Historical Fiction\\n- Picked for the Good Morning America Book Club\\n- CWs: R4pe, sexual assault, general misogyny...\",\n",
       " 'Five big stars\\nI love books with quirky, intelligent characters. So, I was immediately drawn to Lessons in Chemistry. Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in the early 1960s, back when women were a rarity in the field. Headstrong and independent, she refuses to tow the line expected. I came more than a decade later, but men’s attitudes hadn’t changed much in the 70s. So, I totally related to her, especially her relationship with Six Thirty.\\nThe book follows her as she becomes a single mother and then the star of a tv cooking show. There is a dry humor to the book. Actually, the humor gets more broad as the story goes on. I started off chuckling. Then snorting. Then laughing out loud to the point my husband insisted on knowing what I was reading.\\nI sometimes have a problem when dogs are anthropomorphized. But it didn’t bother me here, even when his thoughts were included. I only wish my dog understood 900 words.\\nThe writing here is smart, descriptive, engaging. I found myself chortling over phrase after phrase - the sheer exactness of them. “Every day she found parenthood like taking a test for which she had not studied. The questions were daunting and there wasn’t nearly enough multiple choice.” Not only did I love the immediate family of Elizabeth, Madeline and Six Thirty, I adored Mrs. Sloane, Dr. Mason, Rev. Wakefield, Walter. While the book is humorous, there’s also a lot of emotion packed into it. I adored the ending. (I also loved that Garmus thanked her dogs in her Acknowledgments.) I even loved that I learned a thing or two about cooking.\\nI can’t recommend this enough. I can’t wait to see what Ms. Garmus comes up with next.\\nMy thanks to Netgalley and Doubleday Books for an advance copy of this book.\\n\\nUpdate - I just read this a second time for my book club. If possible, I think I loved it even more the second time.',\n",
       " 'Anything less than a 5-star review for Bonnie Garmus’s debut novel is a minority opinion, so take my 4-star thoughts with a grain of salt. Or as the book’s heroine Elizabeth Zott would say, a grain of sodium chloride.\\n\\nLessons in Chemistry tells the story of a brilliant scientific mind in the 1960s. Only problem is that the mind is in the body of the woman. Not just any woman, but an atypical one who has no interest in marriage or the other traditional trappings of domestic life. Still, one thing leads to another, and she finds herself with a daughter living in the suburbs. Because of the gender roles of that era, her passions and talents for chemistry are going to waste until she ends up with a nightly television show teaching other women how to cook. “Suppers at Six” finally gives home-bound, invisible moms a platform to ask questions, dream big, and prioritize themselves. It also puts items like “acetic acid” on their shopping lists. (That’s vinegar for all you non-sciency types like me.)\\n\\nI enjoyed my time with Elizabeth Zott and look forward to whatever Bonnie Garmus writes next. My slight hesitation in fully recommending Lessons in Chemistry is that it deals with some very serious themes. One major scene and plot point deals with sexual assault, and I just wish it hadn’t gone allllllll the way there. I think when picking up a book like this I’m looking to escape darker reads that include violence against women. Alas, rape, lather, rinse, repeat. Sigh.\\n\\nThe novel’s manuscript was snatched up in a bidding war for adaptation rights by Apple TV+ pre-publication, so actress Brie Larson is already cast to play Elizabeth Zott. If the series is faithful to the novel, it’ll end up feeling like a #metoo-era feminist woman took a time machine back to the 1960s. I’ll definitely be tuning in when it debuts, but personally I hope it softens the novel’s sharp edges a bit.\\n\\nBlog:',\n",

       " '\"Lessons in Chemistry\" by Bonnie Garmus is a delightful debut novel!\\n\\nElizabeth Zott, a research chemist at Hastings Research Institute, believes in equality, not a popular opinion in 1952. The all male research team she works with talks down to her rather than appreciating her as the driving force behind their projects. She\\'s weary of males talking over her when she presents her findings and taking credit for her work.\\n\\nThe one exception to this is Calvin Evans, a gifted research scientist at HRI, and a two time Nobel-prize nominee, who has fallen in love with Elizabeth and her brilliant mind. The attraction is real!\\n\\nElizabeth views herself as a scientist but knows, by experience, female scientists are virtually non-existent. Ten days before graduating with her master\\'s degree from UCLA, the admissions committee rescinded her application to the doctoral program.\\n\\nAn \\'unfortunate event\\' happened and Elizabeth actions were determined to be the cause. She knows that getting her PhD is no longer possible but she\\'ll never give up her dream. Her only regret is not having more No. 2 pencils to use when the \\'unfortunate event\\' took place!\\n\\nTen years later, Elizabeth is a single mother living with her adorable daughter, Madeline, their dog, Six-thirty, and hosting the daily TV cooking show, Supper at Six. The show is an instant hit and Elizabeth is the beautiful, but reluctant, star!\\n\\nIn front of a live audience, Elizabeth uses her platform to not only teach women about the chemistry of cooking, but about life being more important than cooking! It\\'s about following your dream of having a family and a career just like men do!\\n\\nWhat a delightful story with a mid 20th Century timeline. If I could spend time with a character, it would absolutely be Elizabeth. I applaud her resilience, resourcefulness, and unwavering belief that women are as worthy as men. If I was in her shoes, I would wear a No. 2 pencil behind my ear or in my hair, too!\\n\\nA bit of a rebel, smart as a whip, she speaks her mind without holding back, and believes in what\\'s right. She loves her daughter and Six-thirty, the dog, who knows 600+ words and has a significant role in this story. He\\'s quite the canine character and loves Madeline and Elizabeth as much as they love him. It\\'s pretty special!\\n\\nThis is an amazing debut novel with quirky characters, socially relevant topics, emotional swings, winks of humor and laugh-out-loud moments!

       " 'I have a lot of thoughts. For the sake of my own energy and sanity, I’m just going to bullet point the things I want to say:\\n\\n•I read several reviews prior to reading that spoke to the harmful white feminism portrayed in this book and I agree with those reviews. Elizabeth Zott is the ideal, amazingly beautiful, shockingly intelligent white woman who is discriminated against due to her gender, and her feminist “rants” reek of privilege. Especially when using slavery as a comparison to being a housewife? No. Not the same.\\n\\n•Her daughter, Madeline, was so over the top it was ridiculous. She “befriended” a priest and investigated her father’s family tree? At age 4? It’s weird.\\n\\n•Elizabeth is ANNOYING. Like…SO annoying. Both my parents have PhDs in research chemistry and I can attest to the fact that they call salt SALT and vinegar VINEGAR. And they know how to have social interactions with other humans.🙄 Because they aren’t PRETENTIOUS!! Also, it’s unrealistic that just because she knows one area of chemistry she automatically knows how to cook and knows all the biological reactions that occur in the body. There are a million different avenues of chemistry, and food science is COMPLETELY different than “abiogenesis” which was supposedly her main area of study. So you’re telling me she’s just an expert at literally all chemistry? 🤔 I call BS. Elizabeth Zott is the EPITOME of a “I’m not like other girls” girl. No please.✋🏼 Women can be smart AND socially adept.\\n\\n•The way the author pits science and religion against one another is exhausting. As if a person couldn’t possibly have a rational, scientific brain and also believe in something supernatural. 😑 She relies HEAVILY on negative stereotypes of the Catholic Church to prove her point that religion is ignorant, and I’m just tired of this argument. It’s boring, small-minded, and irritating to belittle someone or a group of people you personally disagree with REGARDLESS OF WHAT CAMP YOU’RE IN. Can we be adults and agree to disagree without being petty and taking a shot at someone’s intelligence?\\n\\n•This book is marketed as being funny. It’s not. It’s heavy with sexism, rape, implied pedophilia, and death. It’s not funny at all?\\n\\nOverall, I’m really disappointed by this book. It’s such a waste, because it was well written and I found myself weirdly entertained. Although, the farther removed from the book I get, the more problematic I find it.',\n",
       " \"This is a Historical Fiction book. I had so many different feelings about this book. I really did not like Elizabeth's character in this book. I did not like that Elizabeth was so smart, but she was so dumb at the same time. I hate that she did not see people walking all over her. I also did not think she really put a fight for women rights. I just felt she did everything to make things hard on herself. I really wanted to love this book, but I just did not. I hated the first half of this book, and the second half of this book I liked not loved. I also did not understand the dog stuff, and I felt all the dog stuff was weird. I found parts of this book funny. The ending was good, but I saw it coming. I was kindly provided an e-copy of this book by the publisher (Doubleday Books) or author (Bonnie Garmus) via NetGalley, so I can give an honest review about how I feel about this book.

Elizabeth Zott only ever wanted to be a scientist—but because she’s a woman in the 1960s, she has to go begging for beakers despite being the smartest researcher in the building. After Elizabeth is ostensibly fired for being unwed and pregnant (but really for being smarter than her boss and dating a rival scientist he loathes), she can’t make ends meet. Out of desperation she accepts a job hosting a tv show called Supper at 6. She loves to cook, because cooking, after all, is chemistry. The producers want her to smile and look pretty, but Elizabeth is much more interested in teaching housewives not just how to make dinner, but how to change their lives.

       " \"2.5\\nMay Contain Spoilers\\n\\nI'd never agreed more with the messages of a novel however, I grumbled throughout this audiobook. It's as if Garmus took every feminist rhetoric, issue and stance and made Elizabeth Zott the denouncer of every.single.one - gender pay gaps, stay-at-home mothers not being appreciated, women in STEM, working women, sexual harassment and the whole gamut of issues. I had to double-check the period this novel was set in. There were quite a few aspects that felt anachronistic. Anachronisms drive me crazy and their presence ruined many historical novels for me. I also think it's lazy and assumes that the readers are ignorant, not to mention, that it doesn't take that long to google.\\n\\nAnd then there was the preachiness, and the monologues, and the overexplaining. Oh, and it's all tell no show. Also, I got no sense of the time and place.\\n\\nI'm a staunch feminist and I agreed and/or recognised most issues, still, I just found this novel annoying, heavy-handed, and way too on the nose.\\n\\nI like my literature nuanced and I don't want things to be (over)explained, I am (still) capable of chewing my own food/ideas, thank you very much.\",\n",

They are dominating almost every field, academics, science, business, innovation, you name it and they're at the top of everything that mattered. Then how could they accept this amazing female chemist beating them at their game? A woman who is strong, speaks her mind, does not do favors to climb the career ladder, and who does not take lightly when told how women should behave or must stay back to take care of family as its her duty as a woman.\\n\\nThis story is funny, full of love, has its moments of sadness but it also stays with the reader after reading it, and that says a lot about this book.

       " '“When women understand chemistry, they begin to understand how things work. When women understand these basic concepts, they can begin to see the false limits that have been created for them.”\\n\\nThat feeling when you know a book is going to be 5 stars early on....... This was extremely exceptional, emotional, and funny! I’m still trying to comprehend how talented an author has to be to incorporate humor into a book that is so emotionally provoking! Very few books have extracted emotions out of me from every single page. Usually, I get a break from my emotions when I read a book, but not this one. This one had the purpose to make me want to cry, be angry, laugh, and be angry again.\\n\\n“I have to admit, some days the human race makes me sick.”\\nElizabeth Zott is my fucking role model. I am inspired to use logic and facts to make conclusions for everything I do and say. Well, maybe not when I\\'m writing reviews because my emotions usually win with that one. Yes, I have heard that \"those days\" were extremely hard for women scientists, but goddamn! Garmus did not hold back with explicit details of this in Elizabeth’s life and emotions. Garmus did not need to say science was toxic and sexist back then, instead, she showed us. It was actually hard to read some of the events that occurred back then. The disdain and constant adversity were so much. You think these people are scientists so they would be able to reason more than the general public. NOPE! Because when it comes down to it any kind of discrimination against a group of people has nothing to do with facts.\\n\\n“Children set the table. Your mother needs a moment to herself.”\\nShe inspired not only me but so many characters in the book. Who would have known that you can use a cooking show, something that originally had sexist intentions, to get women to start thinking more critically? Only Elizabeth Zott could have pulled this off! I sort of knew food had some chemistry component to it, but like….it really is chemistry guys. If I could use scientific terms while I cook, I would be so powerful. I’m really impressed by how even though Garmus gave us a character that didn’t want to be confined by the roles women are placed in, she still gave motherhood the rightful crown it deserves. That shit is hard and it’s about time it was made pretty clear. Garmus illustrates how this is a patriarchal scam to contribute to the supposed little to no value of this role.\\n\\nAlso, we got a romance?! A really unique one. I was extremely invested in it as much as I was invested in the whole book. Calvin Evans and Elizabeth Zott were peculiarly made for each other. Through their romance, we learn about them individually. There was still this incompleteness since they never really completely opened up to each other, yet I still enjoyed their relationship more than relationships in books that are promoted as romance. Garmus could have easily written Elizabeth as someone who didn’t need love or a man, Zott is still human and I loved seeing it.\\n\\nThis is in the description so it’s not really a spoiler if you’ve read it. If not, maybe it is. The mother-daughter bond Garmus had in this book was amazing. I’m so happy we didn’t get a book where the mother and daughter are constantly fighting, but a daughter that was literally in constant awe of her mother and a mother that never underestimated her daughter. My goodness! I really enjoyed these parts of the book. Zott might not have had the conventional family but she truly had one with her daughter and other characters by the end of the book.\\n\\nAlmost every character illustrated the many kinds of people that play a role in the lack of change in society. We had of course the men who directly did bring down women. What we also had were the men who knew what was happening but were scared or did not care enough to try to change things because well it didn’t affect them. This was explored by Walter pine, a man I genuinely expected to hate but had a place in my heart by the end. The ones that break my heart are the women who in today’s terms are called “the pick me’s.” The ones who genuinely think that bringing other women down will grant them favor with men. I really really really liked that Garmus gave a lot of these characters growth. It emphasizes that some human beings can learn to be better people, even if they start out as truly despicable.\\n\\nSix Thirty, Elizabeth’s dog, has my whole heart! More books where the dogs also have a pov, please!!\\n\\nSure things for women are better than they were in the past, at least here in America. It is still a great mission to remind us of how this fight started so we can continue to fight it. Thankful for all the women who paved a way for us.\\n\\nOkay guys, I’m now wondering how many of the famous men scientists back in the day stole work from women or at least never gave credit!!!!

What makes Covey happy is swimming in the ocean, her best friend, Bunny, and her boyfriend, Gibbs. She and Gibbs plan to escape the island and attend college in London, once each of them graduates high school.\\n\\nWe get bits of Covey's story and the story of Byron and Benny, interspersed with Eleanor's recording. But then more and more gets added into the story, a kind of throw everything in but the kitchen sink approach. Eventually there are too many characters, too many POVs, too many shifts in timeline, the feeling that there is a checklist of social issues to hit, and some extremely short chapters that chop the story into more pieces. Byron and Benny, for all the advantages they had growing up, or maybe because of all the advantage they had growing up, are very immature and selfish. Byron, with the successful career, is hampered in his personal life by a lack of ability or willingness to communicate. Benny, who lets impulsiveness rule her life, is her own worst enemy. I thought I was going to care about the characters and I did like the parents of Byron and Benny but the story becomes diluted by too much of everything.\\n\\nPublication: February 1st 2022\\n\\nThank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine and NetGalley for this ARC.\",\n",

I did enjoy the multiple POV's and multiple timelines with short chapters. The other element that I found really enjoyable was the focus on food, recipes that can transform a person back to a different time and place (I'm already thinking of green bean casserole...yum!). We are left with a clean ending with all of our questions answered.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this book was trying to cover too many topics. It went wide instead of deep. In the section About the Author, it mentions that Charmaine Wilkerson is a former journalist. That would explain it. Journalism and novel writing are two completely different arts. Journalism is more fact driven while novels are designed to stir the feelings (well at least good ones). One of the key topics in Black Cake was recently covered in another book that I read, and I thought that the other book was better. It took a bit of time for Black Cake to pick up steam, and there were way, WAY too many B names: Byron, Bert, Benny, Bunny, Bennett. How exactly is a reader supposed to keep all of these names straight? The use of foreshadowing was also too heavy because I could foresee each and every reveal. The characters would always explain their thoughts, not very subtly, and would repeat their thoughts several times. This I would have edited down. As a reader, I want something to ponder, but this was spoon fed a little too much.\\n\\nOverall, this was an interesting book once it took off.\\n\\n*Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.\\n\\n2023 Reading Schedule\\nJan Alice in Wonderland\\nFeb Notes from a Small Island\\nMar Cloud Atlas\\nApr On the Road\\nMay The Color Purple\\nJun Bleak House\\nJul Bridget Jones’s Diary\\nAug Anna Karenina\\nSep The Secret History\\nOct Brave New World\\nNov A Confederacy of Dunces\\nDec The Count of Monte Cristo\",\n",
       " 'Siblings Benny and Byron, estranged for years, fulfill their mother’s last wishes by meeting to listen to an audio recording of their mother telling her life story, including the secrets she held onto for decades. It was quite the story she tells, starting with her life on an unnamed island in the Caribbean, how she ended up in England, and finally the U.S. I was totally invested as the story moved between the past and the present, although the multiple alternating timelines/characte became confusing, even more so as the story progressed.\\n\\nI enjoy stories with well-developed characters and plots that deal with sensitive and thought-provoking issues. I understand the author wanted to highlight how people’s lives have been defined by violence, secrets, sacrifice, and prejudice. I appreciated the meaning behind the cultural significance of food and a recipe handed down for generations.\\n\\nBut yet….\\n\\nThere are books with characters who have issues that are woven organically and subtly into the plot. And then there are issue books. Unfortunately, this one reads like the latter. Multiple coincidences drive the plot forward and the author indulges in the “kitchen sink” style of storytelling, with every possible social issue thrown in for dramatic effect, bordering on the ridiculous and causing some eye-rolling from this reader. I don’t enjoy the heavy-handed approach, which keeps me from becoming invested in a story or caring about the characters.\\n\\nThis was a debut that Marialyce and I looked forward to reading, but it left both of us disappointed.

       " \"‘I owe it to you to let you know about my past because this is your story, too.’\\n\\nIdentity is a complex amalgamation, a mixture and intersection of family lineage, culture, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and more. A mixture not unlike a recipe for food, a metaphor that deliciously entwines the story and characters in Black Cake, the debut novel by Charmaine Wilkerson. An estranged brother and sister arrive for their mother’s funeral, only to discover she has left them a lengthy recording that upends everything they know about their family. Wilkerson’s many layered and endlessly twisting novel directly confronts ideas of identity as these siblings have their foundation pulled out from under them and must reassess everything they know about the Bennet family and, in turn, themselves. This book is packed with ideas, and while it occasionally feels a bit overstuffed the fast moving pace keeps you page turning as lives twist and history unravels itself into the present. Moving across multiple decades and continents, Wilkerson’s stunning debut is a smart and heartfelt investigation of family, culture, generational divides and the ways our identities coalesce ‘’\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nByron and Benny Bennet—yes, there are a lot of B names in this—haven’t spoken since Benny fled a family gathering years previous and never showed at their father’s funeral. Their mother, Eleanor, had always wanted to tell them the truth about her life, but with the family fractured she never found the time until it was too late, leaving instead a long recording that begins with telling her children they have a sister they’ve never met and a story of a girl named Covey living in the Caribbean in the 1960s. This book is a wild ride, with potential murder, lives forever altered multiple times, aliases, secrets, and much, much more. Yet at the center of it all is black cake, a recipe central to the Bennet family from their mother’s childhood on the island and a symbol of blending culture, stories and lives. And a final request that her children eat a black cake she left them when the time is right. But as they are shaken from each revelation that also reopens old wounds, will that time ever come? And who was Eleanor really?\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nWilkerson impressively juggles a lot here, rotating between the past and present in brief chapters that, while written entirely in third person, spirals through the characters to reframe on their specific lives, emotions and thoughts. The style gives each character their individualism while also weaving them together to view each individual as connected through the community of their shared lives. ‘’ Wilkerson writes of Byron, but this sentiment is universal for each character and as the story progresses we see just how true this is.\\n\\nAs we watch Covey run from her past and reconfigure her life and identity&mash;shaped in the forges of violence, chance and a society that creates barriers for women of color—we also see how many people become connected to her story and can be affected by it. While this initially includes those who helped her escape and could come under the literal gun of the crime family surrounding the death of her forced marriage it becomes more solidified when she has children and extends her lineage. But what is key is the notion we are all connected, and each individual life reverberates against all the rest in the great orchestra of humanity where one wrong turn or sudden tragedy can sound the discordant note that derails the whole.\\n\\nWilkerson attempts a further examination of connectivity by demonstrating lineage and heritage not only of familiar links, but as occupants of the earth and members of the long history of humanity. ‘’ she writes, in an omniscient narration that sometimes dips too close to being its own personality without grounding into the narrative itself. It works in theory but the practice of it in the text is a bit rushed and feels like a tacked on aftereffect used too sporadically. A chapter will open with telling of how things were, say, hundreds of years ago and then connect it to the actions of a character, told without familiarity before returning to the normal narration style. I like the point being made, though it is a bit jarring and seems more like a transition crutch than a natural part of the narrative but overall it serves the theme of connectivity and heritage well. Particularly in the sense of generational trauma, as metaphored (spell check tells me this is not a real word but I’m coining it now so feel free to normalize it) in a scene with the character Elly cutting her foot on an ancient gate buried in the sand, which fills into a larger theme of how best intentions can come across as hurt later on.\\n\\nWhich is an aspect of the novel I really appreciate, as it juxtaposes generational perspectives and how the disconnect chafes on either party. The siblings begin the novel processing their mother’s story as one of betrayal for keeping secrets, while we recognize that her and her husband view secret keeping as an act of mercy and to protect those closest to them. And this older generation that sees value in secrets is shown as being appalled by the younger generation that puts their entire lives in the public eye through social media, fearful that so much openness leaves them vulnerable to harm. To them, their actions are one of protection but are seen by the younger generation as rejection. Benny’s narrative positions her sense of identity into the crosshairs of this clash, with her dad mistaking her bisexuality as mere confusion instead of accepting it as an aspect of her selfhood. I particularly enjoyed this aspect of the novel, having been a similar recipient of the criticism and frustrated by the avoidance that insisting someone’s identity is mere confusion makes you internalize shame and have a hard time trusting yourself.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nThere is a rich irony here, because so much of each character’s journey is making peace with being a complex self, and while so much of life is affected by ‘’ they find their sense of self doesn’t fit into tidy, socially-prescribed boxes. Each character discovers they are ‘’, being too much the same aspects that they are not enough of and feeling alienated because of it.\\n\\nCovey is a black woman with a Chinese father, for example, living in a culture that has absorbed aspects of colonization into itself. ‘’ Wilkerson writes about Covey and her friend in London, Elly, ‘’\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nThe way colonialism intersects with traditional culture becomes a major theme in , best demonstrated in the titular food itself. As noted early on, black cake has roots outside the island, but has transformed into a specific cultural artifact of the island. There are some really great foodie aspects to this book, especially when Wilkerson addresses food ethics and culture through the character of tv food expert, Marble. ‘’ she say when facing criticism for addressing these issues, ‘engaging in’ Her aim isn’t to judge but to examine the ways food has a complex heritage, which is mirrored in the realizations of lineage in the primary characters who can trace their roots across social, racial, and political “borders”. ‘’ Marble says, drawing the direct line between the two. Over time things change, adapt, become part of something else while still retaining what they once were and always will be. This, too, is mirrored in the many transformations seen in the book and the many characters who have a different name in different stages of their life, such as the childhood Bunny later being swimming icon Etta Pringles.\\n\\nbranches into many applications of this idea to examine it from a multitude of angles. It also makes sure to call-out social issues that would inform up the character’s lives. The book does seem to overextend itself in acknowledging all these topics, but one might wish it would pause in order to better explore them. There is something to be said about honing in to make sure to say one or two things really well rather than saying a lot at a surface level (a few do feel a bit shoe-horned in). However, Wilkerson somehow manages to make her maximization of social critique quite enjoyable as they are folded into the larger narrative in a way that makes us realize they are important to recognize but, as Byron says, ‘ ’The most successful address very in-the-moment issues in context of the themes and with the shadow of the past cast across them. ‘’ Wilkerson writes about Byron, and his racial identity is an active role on his path through society, particularly in the face of authority such as the workplace or law enforcement.\\n\\n''\\n\\nThis is a soaringly good debut that should very well be a big book of the year. As a debut this has some mechanical hiccups and a few stylistic choices that didn’t always work, as well as seeming a bit overly long as the latter portion of the novel was overly concerned with putting a tidy, satisfying bow on every loose end. That said, honestly, I love it all. This was such an engaging book with a fast pace that made it nearly impossible to. A few nitpicks aside, Wilkerson takes a purpose in her sights and hits the target dead on which makes the occasionally rough flight path all good by achieving its goal so well. is a really heartfelt book that tackles some difficult subjects and does so by successfully orchestrating the reader’s emotions along with the story. This is a beautiful tale about family and one that will certainly find it’s way into your heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘’\",\n",
       " 'no one is more disappointed to have to give this rating than i am—particularly because the first few chapters of black cake had me convinced that i\\'d picked up a 4/5-star read.\\n\\nthis is one of those instances where i feel compelled to be completely honest about how little i enjoyed the actual, physical act of slogging my way through this narrative. so, to be totally transparent, most of this review is based on my gut reaction to what i feel is a glaring lack of technical skill. with the heart was there, the premise was right up my alley (i love multi-generational family sagas that volley between past and present, especially sagas interested in interrogating race + class), and i initially really liked the two narrators, benny and byron, and their alternating perspectives.\\n\\nbut suffers the effects of a debut novel without a(n invested) helping hand to guide it. i don\\'t know what the hell is going on over at penguin books, but their editors are clearly sleeping on the job.\\n\\nto illustrate my point, i\\'m going to give a little list of what didn\\'t work for me (all signs of a lack of technical skill + a need for stronger, more invested editors)\\n• charmaine wilkerson\\'s prose leaves a lot to be desired. the language is clean and uncomplicated, which for some readers really enhances a story; many need invisible prose to fully immerse themselves in new worlds. i\\'m unfortunately not one of those people. i prefer to sink my teeth into complex prose that feels intensive and experimental, i love (and live for) and distinct character voices, and in the case of there was nothing to grab onto and chew. the prose is cotton candy that immediately disintegrates on the tongue. to be more clear, wilkerson\\'s writing is simplistic to the point of dullness and prone to cheesy repetition, foreshadowing, and abortive scene-writing. on the topic of repetition, we have habitual, nursery rhyme-like narration such as the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this piece of criticism is mostly a difference in (subjective/artistic) opinion, and many enjoy this sort of writing, but i, personally, despise it. i understand going for a few repetition style points, but the amount of repeating sentences/phrases (in groups of 3\\'s) used throughout this novel started to feel really juvenile.\\n• this leads me into pacing. multi-generational sagas are already difficult to tackle in terms of temporality/chronology, even without a rotating cast of (something like) 10+ narrators. if you\\'ve read my reviews before, you know how much i dislike slipshod head-jumping. well, here we are again 🙄 if you\\'re going to cycle between characters, i need to know that you\\'re doing so primarily for plot convenience. i need the POV switches to serve a creative purpose. i need the selected cast of narrators to feel full-fledged rather than throwaway. and, above all else, i need authors to stop with the tiny one- to two-page chapters for quick little \"hi! bye!\" interludes. the \\'s of the literary world pacing is a complete mess as a result of the constant abbreviated chapters and the 10+ characters (scattered across time and space) who we\\'re leaping between. there\\'s never enough time to settle in with a character and get to know them through narration/interaction because wilkerson relies so heavily on what i call the time-lapse trope.\\n• the \"time-lapse trope\" is not so much a trope as it is the lazy author\\'s way out (through a stylistic narration choice). i\\'ll give you an example of what this looks like:\\n\\n\\n\\ndo you see how wilkerson speeds past any actual legwork she\\'d have to do to thoughtfully communicate these ideas? instead of actually writing a full-bodied interaction with and explanation, she employs near-constant hand-waving to quickly advance the plot—even on micro levels. this is nonstop throughout the 380+ page book. one minute, we\\'ve just been dealt a devastating emotional revelation. the next, we\\'re catapulting past any fallout so we can quickly land on a convenient little wrap-up. it\\'s hard to say whether i hate head-jumping or time-lapse narration more. both are equally infuriating to me and both were constant and unavoidable here (so you can imagine how frustrating this reading experience was).\\n• in addition to the time-lapsed narration, wilkerson leans on plot convenience to tie up loose ends and/or force things to make sense. characters aren\\'t allowed to struggle. they are not permitted ambiguity. they don\\'t get to learn their lessons the hard way. somehow, suddenly, inevitably, they know the right answer, connect the dots right in the nick of time, avoid catastrophe through complete \"coincidence\" (read: authorial manipulation), recognize a stranger as their blood relation as soon as they lay eyes on them again—just \\'cause. just \\'cause it\\'s easiest. just \\'cause it makes the most sense. just \\'cause \"convenience as a narrative crutch\" is far less work than actually sitting down and trying to thread a conflict-driven plot together.\\n• of the 10+ narrators, NONE HAVE ANY PERSONALITY!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are all—every single one—flat, boring, superficial stand-ins for emotional revelations that readers are forcibly shoved into face-first. do you know what would have helped to flesh these characters out?\\n• SOME ACTUAL DIALOGUE. there is little to no dialogue in like i said, wilkerson\\'s chapters are tiny, abridged summaries of a series of life events that readers feel in no way compelled to care about—because there\\'s no actual character interaction occurring. and when character interaction does, on rare occasions, crop up, it is so microscopic, so cut short, so lacking in complexity or personality, that any lasting impact immediately dissolves. my impression of these people is that they\\'re extremely boring and only require a handful of sentences to either ruin a dynamic or wrap it up with a nice, tidy bow (so we know that everything is a-okay and there\\'s no further estrangement to worry over)!\\n• the debate over \"showing vs telling\" in literary circles is one that is heavily steered by western genre conventions that have for centuries worked to undermine anything different or nonwhite—no doubt about it. in many cases, telling over showing can work miracles and enliven a story in strange, unexpected ways (i\\'m thinking of k-ming chang\\'s where the constant narrative compulsion to info-dump family history or speed through crazy life events from the past is gorgeous, engaging, and even emotionally affecting). here, the compulsion to tell rather than show made me want to fling my book at a wall. if i were to hazard a guess, i would say this is probably because of wilkerson\\'s flat prose, artificial characters, and tendency to time-lapse through plot events. if you\\'re going to tell, you have to be tactful about it, you have to go in with intent, and you should probably above all else prioritize your prose so you don\\'t bore your readers to tears.\\n• wilkerson does note that this narrative is meant to be fable-like in her author\\'s note, so this bullet point isn\\'t entirely a critique (as the choice was on some level intended), but the amount of allegorical commentary delivered to readers through these characters is actually wild. and lazy. and overdone. it waters down an otherwise complex family history rife with sociopolitical meaning. wilkerson needs to that her readers can interrogate this meaning on their own, without her explicitly spelling out life lessons like, \"WE MUST PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT OR IT WILL DIE!!!!!!!!!!\" please have more faith in your audience. let your work be complicated without trying to hand us pretty political maxims. it only serves to make an already surface-level narrative even shallower.\\n• small, nitpicky note: when you have two well-acquainted characters talking to each other, it will sound natural to have them address each other by name over and over again. this kind of speech pattern rarely happens in real life. one or two name addresses, okay, i can cut you some slack, i can close my eyes, i can look the other way. two characters are standing and staring at each other, they\\'re maybe a little heated, they\\'re trying to underscore their point. well......over the course of one interaction between byron and benny, they address each other by name sixteen (16) times. sixteen. @ PENGUIN EDITORS: WHAT ARE U DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n• the amount of filler in this book. oh my god. could have been cut in half. narrowed down to a smaller pool of key scenes, told through three pairs of eyes (benny, byron, and covey). those key scenes could then be extended + complicated + edited. prose sharpened. pacing honed. more dialogue implemented. but no. i am doomed to live a life of phantom editing when i\\'m reading books.\\n\\nin some cases, a book checks all of your mood/aesthetic/thematic boxes, but its delivery is an unending train wreck. this is one of those cases. too much technical rage. i need to go lie down and recover.',\n",

Indeed they are, but this compulsion of so many authors to included as many as they can into their story, often interrupts the point and poignancy of the story.\\n\\nIt made me sad that what would have been a fabulous story of family, ancestry, and the generational aspirations became mired in the miasma of beating the reader over the head.

       " 'Black Cake is the debut novel of Charmaine Wilkerson. The story begins with siblings Bryon and Benedetta (Benny) Bennett meeting with their mother’s estate attorney. The two siblings haven’t spoken to each other for eight years when Benny felt rejected after revealing to her family that she was a lesbian. She did not return six years ago when her father died but has come back for her mother’s funeral. The siblings learn that their mother, Eleanor, has left them an eight-hour video to tell the two children the surprising real history of their parents. She has also left a frozen black cake for them to share when the time is right. The black cake is a rum-soaked fruit cake made from a beloved family recipe.\\n\\nThe video introduces a large cast of characters from Eleanor’s past, beginning with her life on an unnamed Caribbean island, traveling to London, Scotland, and eventually Southern California. There is also background information on Bryon and Benny, neither of whom seem to be able to form happy relationships.\\n\\nWith some restraint, it could have been a really good story. Because the author decided to cover a plethora of social issues, including an arranged marriage, parental abandonment, workplace rape, police brutality against blacks, gambling, racial and gay discrimination, forced adoption, domestic abuse, and protection of the ocean, the story seemed weighed down at times. If she had just focused on the concepts of home, identity, family secrets, second chances, and fewer social issues, I would have enjoyed it much more. Many of the chapters are short and out of order chronologically, giving the story a disjointed feeling. On the positive side, I enjoyed the historical aspects of island life and the emphasis on the importance of food and traditions. The book asks important questions about racial identity and what someone would be willing to do in the name of love.\\n\\n3-stars. Thank you to Kathleen Q at Penguin Random House for my widget!

       " 'This was a very slow read-- 15 days for me. I rate it 3.5 stars rounded up. It is the story of \"Covey\\' Coventina Lyncook, born on an unnamed Caribbean island. Her father gets into major debt to a loan shark and agrees to marry her in order to pay off his debt. But Covey doesn\\'t want to marry him. How she escapes and her subsequent life of hardship,pain and determination to survive is told in flashbacks, between the present day and her travels to Britain and then the US. There is no graphic violence. But there is a rape, not graphically described. The racism encountered by the characters in the book is also described. The descriptions of life on the island were very interesting.\\nThere is a central theme of baking the traditional Caribbean \"Black Cake.\"\\nTwo quotes:\\nOn life \"The oceans are a challenge, Mitch thinks. And what about a person\\'s life? How do you make a map of that? The borders people draw between themselves.

       " \"We are all little bits granulated from far, far bigger bits.\\n\\nCharmaine Wilkerson creates a tale so far-reaching that we have to almost give pause after each chapter. Wilkerson is a storyteller blessed with the ability to go deep, so deep that we can almost hear the breathlessness of her characters and feel their angst and sorrow as if it were our own.\\n\\nBlack Cake begins with an ending. Eleanor Bennett has passed away in California and her friend and lawyer, Charles Martin, has requested the presence of her children, Byron and Benny. Eleanor has left a video for them to view that contains roadways traveled by Eleanor and unbeknownst even to her own children. She felt it was time. But time had been cruel in so many ways to this family. Decisions made, life choices reached for and condemned by others, and secrets held in dark places.\\n\\nAnd the Bennett family lived life in fractured pieces. Benny left a family gathering for Thanksgiving dinner in 2010 with the sharpness of words serrating her heart. She never looked back.....never once to her parents, never once to her brother. And in those times, her father died. No farewell from Benny. Byron continued to stay by his mother's side. Byron, the successful sea biologist and writer. Benny, the lost wandering soul, searching for her niche in life and never quite finding it.\\n\\nWilkerson knows that all stories, great and small, have an origin. The Bennett's tumultuous story has its beginning on an unnamed island in the West Indies of the Caribbean. It's the 1960's and we are introduced to a young girl named Covey. It is Covey's story that will be at the center of a myriad of concentric circles tipped by the thrust of her stone. As readers, we will be grasping the hardcover of this book with both hands. Wilkerson sets one adventure upon the back of another. She's relentless in her telling. This island serves as a springboard to London, to California, and a few other spots along the way.\\n\\nBlack Cake is a specialty. It stems from rich ingredients steeped over time in rum and port and served on the best of occasions. Black Cake seems to reflect life somehow. The end result is not often guaranteed, but having an inner appreciation for the differing textures and fragrances of rare ingredients seems to lift the spirit to a higher plane.\\n\\nI received a copy of this novel through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to Random House (Ballantine Books) and to the talented Charmaine Wilkerson for the opportunity.\",\n",

       " '“Sometimes, the stories we don’t tell people about ourselves matter even more than the things we do say.”\\n\\n\\nSo many good quotes in this remarkable novel about identity, loss, family, forgiveness, understanding, expectations, and culture. Well, that’s a few of the topics(ingredients) debut author Charmaine Wilkerson throws into her mixture of a novel. For example, environmental issues get a strong nod in the story. Yes, “Black Cake” is more than a story of a cake. The Black Cake in the story represents history, personal history that carries not only cultural particulars, but the blood sweat and tears of a woman.\\n\\nAuthor Wilkerson wants us all to question how well we really know our parents, friends, family. In telling the history of protagonist Eleanor Bennett, there are a wealth of characters who form her story. Wilkerson provides short chapters which are character driven, with multiple narratives and backstories. Although the reader needs to juggle a multiple of characters, they way in which Wilkerson tells her story makes it easy to follow. Even a couple outlier characters are easy to remember because of context. I found this multi-layered story fascinating.\\n\\nAs the story opens, the children of Eleanor Bennett are called home for the funeral of their mother. The children have been estranged from each other. Eleanor’s final wish is that they listen to a recording she made explaining her life. And what a life Eleanor had, unbeknownst to her children. There is subtle humor in here as well. For example, Eleanor towers over 6 feet in height. She’s described as “big boned”, not fat but strong, and an imposing silhouette. I thought of a Serena Williams-like figure. Well, in the 1970’s, she surfed in the rough waves of southern California, in a two-piece orange swimsuit. At the time, only young white people (mostly boys/men) surfed, and a 6 foot athletic black woman hanging 10 was something to be noted. Yes, she bakes black cake and she surfs, and there’s more.\\n\\nThis is the second novel I’ve read in February 2022 by black authors who highlight cultural expectations. Black people don’t surf. Nor do they swim, nor are they scientists (and in the previous novel I read they weren’t concert violinist). I am appreciating authors challenging readers to confront biases.\\n\\nThis is a beautiful story of an unknown family history. I’m sure all families have some hidden gem that someone was too afraid to tell. Genealogy Sites can tell you some fact, it’s the personal stories that can make identity real. Perhaps if we’ve known more of our own ancestors struggles, we as a world could be more empathetic to immigrants. But that’s another subject.\\n\\nThis is a 5 star novel that should not be missed!\\n\\nSome favored quotes:\\n\\n\\n\\n“More people’s lives have been shaped by violence than we like to think. And more people’s lives have been shaped by silence than we think.”\\n\\n“I have lived long enough to see that my life has been determined not only by the meanness of others but also by the kindness of others, and their willingness to listen.”',\n",
       " 'In the few or maybe many (I’m really not sure) family drama books I’ve read, complicatedness is usually well done, but so far this one takes the cake. Pun intended.\\n\\nI was mostly uninterested for a minute when I started, but when Eleanor started to share more about her past, I mysteriously started to pay more attention. This one knew how to grab your heart and mind and make you feel a part of this family. How does a woman hold so many secrets?\\n\\nI was entranced by how everything came together by the end. The truth sometimes does bring people more together and this book did just that. I connected with the characters individually and even though most of them weren’t perfect, I could understand their actions and feelings. Wilkerson does a great job of being completely open with almost every character’s thoughts.',\n",

Ma had lied to her and Byron about so many things that Benny can’t even begin to guess how their mother’s story is going to bring them to the sister they never knew about, much less the life they have now. Has Benny told that many lies about her own life? No, not like these. Not even close”.\\n\\nA GORGEOUS *DEBUT*…..voluminous in scope…extensive billowing….swirling….surging > en route towards the truth a brother and sister will learn about their mother only when it’s too late to directly ask her any questions…..\\n\\n“Six years ago, Byron and his mother sat in the church across from his father’s coffin up in L. A. county, waiting for Benny to arrive, but no Benny. Later Byron thought he saw his sister skirting the burial grounds in the back of a car. She’d be there any minute, he thought. But, still, no Benny. Only a text from her later, saying ‘I’m sorry’. Then silence. For months at a time. Then years.\\n“As each year went by, he was less certain that Benny had been there that day or that he’d ever had a sister to begin with”.\\n\\n“Your mother has left them a message, the lawyer, Mr. Mitch says”.\\n“There’s an entire file box labeled Estate of Eleanor Bennett.

Benny shifts her seat closer to Byrons and leans in to look”.\\n\\n*Black cake*…..\\n…..Black Cake — literally and figuratively connects brotherhood, sisterhood, family, nourishment, and love through the stories we pass down —even those inconceivable stories….\\n“Byron catches himself smiling. Ma and Dad used to share a slice of cake every year to mark their anniversary. It wasn’t the original wedding cake, they said, not anymore. Ma would make a new one every five years or so, one layer only, and put it in the freezer. Still, she insisted that any black cake, steeped as it was in rum and port, could have lasted the full length of their marriage”.\\n“I want you to sit down together and share the cake when the time is right. You’ll know when”.\\n“Benny covers her mouth with one hand”.\\n“Love Ma”.\\n“Benny starts to cry”.\\n\\nWhen I finished this novel and then read the authors notes,\\nI kept asking myself, “how in the world does a new author write such a vibrant - emotional - fulfilling- story…..(with characters who struggle against stereotypes — colorism — identity- prejudices, racism, friendships - political strife - personal pride that got in the way, educational history, characters to root for — with stunning enjoyment tales about the Caribbean beaches, swimming, (a Black woman long distance champion), surfing, island foods, ( dried fruit in rum), etc.?”\\n\\n“Black Cake” is so exquisite — so beautiful — so deeply thought provoking…..\\nI mean how in the world does a mother live with a deeply personal painful secret ….

       " '3.5 stars, rounded down\\n\\nI was really looking forward to this book club read this month, but unfortunately this book didn\\'t connect for me like I was hoping it would.\\n\\nIt\\'s a combination of a few things:\\nThe storytelling is very disjointed, with a plethora of characters and none of them fully realized or developed. Part of the story is supposedly a recording of Benny and Byron\\'s mother telling them the story of her life via an audio recording played after her death. Yet we get the perspectives of others intertwined with these recordings, so I wasn\\'t sure what was recording and what wasn\\'t, except when either Benny or Byron get upset and stop the recording and then we hear about their lives.\\n\\nAlso, there are just so many \"issues\" and \"soapbox moments\" that aren\\'t seamlessly woven into the narrative so they are more forced on the reader rather than an integral part of the plot. This pulled me out of the story so many times. When a writer introduces SO many issues they just get watered down and lost. Some tightening up of the narrative could have given a more cohesive and emotionally resonant story.\\n\\nHeartbreakingly, there are many missed opportunities for reconnection between various characters after they have lost touch either accidentally or on purpose. Yet although they long for the connection, none of them follow through and then it turns out to be too late.\\n\\nI loved the descriptions of food and the discussions about food as it relates to culture and how parts of other cultures are pulled into even native dishes. I liked Benny\\'s idea for a cafe and thought it would be a great setting for a story just in itself.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t a bad read for me, I did think the good outweighed the not-so-good. I just didn\\'t relate well to the characters or care enough about them for this to be a great book.',\n",

Throughout those times, their mother’s Black Cake is one of the things that keeps that bond from dissolving completely for Benny.

The story is told in dual time frames, recounting Elly’s past and in the present with Benny and Byron trying to understand their mother’s past and trying to find their own place . This is a wonderful story of family, imperfect at times in spite of their love . It’s about the power of tradition, but also of abandonment and loss, of dark things that in time are overshadowed by the light of friendship and love .

From the start, her life will be marked by extraordinary events, for the ripples of the Great War are still being felt, even as the Spanish flu arrives on the shores of her South American homeland almost at the moment of her birth.\\n\\nThrough her father's prescience, the family will come through that crisis unscathed, only to face a new one as the Great Depression transforms the genteel city life she has known.

My memory of that book is nothing at all like my experience with Violeta.\\n\\nThe best way I can describe this book is that it narrates events without passion or urgency, in an unnamed country, through the eyes of a narrator we never come to know. I felt extremely distanced from the story\\'s events throughout the whole book. Though tragedy strikes often-- suicide, life-or-death medical emergencies, to name a couple --I felt it was told in such a cold, detached way, almost as if the narrator was reading from a textbook, not describing the events that befell her own family.\\n\\nActually, that paragraph I just wrote is telling. I cannot help myself referring to Violeta as simply \"the narrator\" because that is how she came across. I often find books where an elderly person recounts their life story very effective, but something about it here made it difficult to ever warm to the characters or feel attached to their circumstances.\\n\\nThe story is that of 100-year-old Violeta\\'s life, written for her grandson. It takes us from her childhood raised by an Irish governess somewhere in South America (never said where but contains oblique references to pandemics and military takeovers) to her marriage, an abusive relationship and the arrival of her two children.\\n\\nThough the suicide of one\\'s father, a whirlwind romance that turns abusive, and a child with a drug addiction are all horrific things for a person to experience, Violeta\\'s narrative voice remains flat and unmoving from beginning to end.\\n\\nAnyone got better Allende recommendations for me than this one?',\n",
       " 'Consequential\\nIsabel Allende’s latest novel is spellbinding and beautifully written with the authentic touch of a memoir. In 2020, in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic, Violeta del Valle, now 100 years old and in her last days, writes to her grandson Camilo recounting her life story. Born in Chile in 1920 during the Spanish Flu pandemic, there is a fitting inevitability that a century of war, depression, struggle, discrimination, evil, selflessness, love, loss, illness, joy, and accomplishment should end at another watershed moment of global tragedy. Violeta has lived through many joyful and horrific moments, and the complex nature of life is vividly portrayed through her and those she encounters. A life exquisitely captured by the events of her country and Violeta’s journey with family and friends. While Chile is never mentioned by name, the geography, location descriptions, and events reflect the historical path of Chile.\\n\\nThe story weaves compelling characters with the history of tumultuous times in Chile, through military coups, authoritarian leadership, revolts, boom and bust economic cycles, and dubious connections to spies, criminals and drug cartels. Violeta spells out the relationships with her children, brothers, aunts, uncles, friends, neighbours and the men in her life. Some partners bring her joy, others pain and abuse, but they shape this fascinating woman. Being an astute businesswoman, she overcame commercial issues and discrimination that prevented her from directly owning her business or bank account. She plotted her course with her eldest brother as they grew a successful business keeping the details hidden from the authorities and others.\\n\\nIsabel Allende is masterful at her characterisation, absorbing the related details while never letting the story’s momentum ponder into over-detail. The significant events and range of characters keep this epic story engaging from beginning to end.\\n\\nTo capture a thought in my mind using a famous and appropriate verse:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA fabulously entertaining story that I would highly recommend, and I want to thank my Buddy Ceecee for recommending this to me in glowing terms - you are on point as usual.

       " \"5 vibrant stars for 100 colourful years that defined Violeta’s life. A story of love, tragedy, abuse and survival that is interwoven with the real historical events in South America.\\n\\nOver the years Violeta sees many of her relationships change as people come and go in her life and the woman who once grew up in a wealthy home faced financial ruin, poverty and hardship. However, core to the story was the perpetual cycle of hate and lust in Violeta's own marriage that made this story so memorable, as we are led through an obscene pattern of attraction and rejection, and passion with rage. A complex tale that delivers on everything and candidly told in the form of letters, from Violeta to her grandson Camilo, making this a very readable story.\\n\\nThere is richness to the themes, poignancy to the story, tragedy experienced by many of the characters and beauty in the writing. Another fabulous book by Isabelle Allende.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVioleta’s story is one of survival, through the Spanish flu pandemic, only to tell her story during the current pandemic. It was also a story of endurance through so much hardship and political unrest and turmoil where government officials and death squads acted with absolute impunity. However Violeta was a woman who despite the changing Political and economic environment managed to survive despite living in a tumultuous marriage which often saw her skate perilously close to danger with her husband’s mafia type connections and abusive nature.\\n\\nThe story explores her relationships with her son and daughter, her brother a lifelong supporter and ally of Violeta. However central to the story is her passionate and often violent relationship with her husband, as they spent much of their time together in a perpetual cycle of love and hate. More importantly for me it is a story of personal growth and sacrifice and learning to play the best game with the cards you are dealt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllende’s stories draw on deep knowledge of the historical period that makes this story feel authentic while the candid way the story is written allows the reader to identify with the characters, the story, and the dark themes very easily. So, whilst the story and themes are intense, they never feel heavy.\\n\\nMy only criticism would be the striking similarities between this and the House of the Spirits, and while both are excellent stories, I would like more variation in the storyline and not the familiar pattern of abused women at the hands of a popular dominant male character.\\n\\nNevertheless, this is such an emotionally charged and sweeping story with epic qualities to the writing, the plot, and historical backdrop.\\n\\nImmersive, moving and insightful. A perfect blend of fact and fiction and of the ordinary and extraordinary events and people that shape Violeta’s life.\\n\\nOne of my favourite authors and a highly recommended book.\",\n",
       " '4 solid stars for book of historical fiction, set in Chile, from 1920 until 2020. It is a series of letters by a grandmother to her grown grandson. Violeta was born during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1920. She lives to be 100 and dies of old age during the coronavirus epidemic.\\nShe recounts her life story for her grandson, who is now a Jesuit priest. She has seen much turbulence in her life--WWII, a military coup, dictatorship, murder of friends and family, divorce, being abused for decades by her lover and rebellious children.\\nI enjoyed this book and recommend it to fans of the author, literary fiction and historical fiction. The descriptions of life in Chile are vivid. This is the first book that I have read by Isabel Allende.\\nTwo quotes:\\nHome birth in 1920 Chile: \"Under my Aunt Pilar\\'s direction, Torito, the boy we employed for a wide range of chores, climbed a ladder to hang a labor sling from two steel hooks that he himself had installed in the ceiling.

My Aunt Pia, crouched between her legs, waited to receive the newborn baby before he could fall to the floor.\"\\nEnglish governess: \"She had straw-like blond hair, and that skin as transparent as rice paper, that girls from cold countries sometimes have, which over time become spotted and mercilessly wrinkled.\"\\nThank You Isabel Allende and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, Ballantine Books, for sending me this ebook through NetGalley.\\nPub. date Jan. 25, 2022',\n",
       " \"This was my first book by Isabel Allende and she made me cry like a baby. I didn't expect to have such an emotional reaction to this novel, but I did and it was worth every single tear. I was provided an advance copy of this title; however, all thoughts are my own.\\n\\nVioleta is a story that travels through the lifetime of the character Violeta. It begins with her birth in South America in 1920 just as the Spanish Flu hits. While her family is unaffected by it, things change as the world is brought to its knees by the Great Depression. It is starting here that Violeta experiences such loss and change. Her family moves to a more isolated area where she grows up and takes readers on the journey through her life.\\n\\nEach part of this book is written in letter format to someone that Violeta loves greatly. While I won't say who that is here because I don't want to spoil the novel, it definitely makes for an intriguing story that comes full circle. One of the things that made me fall in love with this novel was this quiet, patient writing that I got on each page. It travels through a 100 years of time, but I was able to soak up every event with such clarity and precision. It almost felt as though Violeta was writing the letters to me. There is a paralleling of events that take place in Violeta's life. Though readers spend time learning about the men she loves, her children, people within her community, Allende is also careful in covering the major political events that occurred at the same time including the women's suffrage movement, the Cuban revolution, the Great Depression, the Chilean dictatorship, and more. As someone who is a huge history nerd, I appreciated getting that history within the context of the story.\\n\\nI think the beauty of this novel is really the idea that all things come full circle. Readers learn so much about Violeta's life, the good, the bad, and the ugly. At the beginning of the novel, she is writing from 2020 during the mist of the COVID pandemic. To see her journey through those 100 years was such a privilege for me as a reader. She evolves as many of us do from a child who has everything to one who had to start over. She has a fiery personality and never seems to do anything whether it's a general task or relationship without passion. Most of all she's human. Like her triumphs, Violeta also acknowledges her short comings. It is a beautiful tale of a woman who decided to live her life on her own terms and not solely on the expectations of others. I connected with this in so many ways. The beauty and grace in the writing is sure to appeal to many readers. If you haven't considered picking this up be sure to add it to your TBR.\",\n",
       " 'Imagine living 100 years … one complete century of, not only your own life evolving and changing, but your country and the world around you as well. What stories would you have to tell about what you’d lived through and experienced, and what would you leave to those who continue on after you?\\n\\nVioleta del Valle was born in Chile during the Spanish Flu pandemic and she dies during the Coronavirus pandemic, but what an incredible life she lives between them! This work of historical fiction reads much like an actual memoir, written by Violeta in a long letter to her beloved grandson, Camilo. In it she details a life that sees prosperity and ruin due to the Great Depression, re-forging her own prosperity in a time where society frowned on women in business, marriages and affairs that range from sedate to tempestuous, the joys and sorrows of motherhood, war in the world at large and political upheaval and danger in her own country, a plethora of social issues, and ultimately finding new purpose in her later years.\\n\\nI’ve never read Isabel Allende before, but she truly has a gift of immersing you in the story and allowing you to see and experience through the eyes of another the world she’s describing. I felt transported and invested in the people and places she took me to, and there were a LOT of them. This is a character-rich novel, and there are so many vibrantly drawn characters to enjoy. Each one brought a wealth of personality and interest to the story, and Violeta’s travels took her to so many places that I almost felt like I was traveling with her.\\n\\nAlthough they’re two different stories, I felt the same draw to this story that I did to Sofia Segovia’s book , and there are points the two have in common, such as the descriptions of the Spanish Flu pandemic, and some parallels between the character Simonopio in Segovia’s book and Torito in this one, both of whom I loved.\\n\\nIt’s a wonderful story, both joyful and heart-breaking, and it’s beautifully told. Honestly my only minor issue is just that the retelling of a hundred-year life can, understandably at moments, feel a little long! Having said that, we should all be so lucky to have a life as full as Violeta!\\n\\n★★★★ ½ (rounded to 5)\\n\\nThanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, Netgalley and author Isabel Allende for this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.

I was fascinated with her life story, and her robust views on feminism, marriage and sexuality.\\n\\n\"Violeta\" was published in January 2022 and on August 2nd of this same year, Isabel Allende will be celebrating her 80th birthday. She continues to lead a remarkable life!\\n\\nMain character, Violeta Del Valle, is born in 1920 Chile, shortly after the Great War and during the Spanish Influenza Pandemic. She is the youngest child in an affluent family, with five older brothers, and lives in a male dominated culture, era, and household.\\n\\nWhat sounds like a memoir is actually a letter from one-hundred-year-old Violeta to her beloved grandson, Camilo. As she nears the end of her long and eventful life, she is gifting him with the memories she holds of the turmoil and passion of living her life to its fullest!\\n\\nThe history this main character sees, experiences and retells to her grandson is beautifully written as this author writes with her heart and soul about Violeta\\'s life. She weaves a story that is vivid and dark, joyous and heartbreaking, pleasurable and painful, fulfilling and disappointing. It feels so personal and emotional, as if the author may have experienced some of this life, as well.\\n\\nI listened to the audiobook narrated by Frances Riddle whose voicing skills are believable as she authentically becomes the character of Violeta. With 13 hours of listening time, it never feels too long, repetitive, or slow.\\n\\nI love this story and have purchased two more of this author\\'s books.

       " 'Violeta Del Valle now 100, writes to her much loved grandson Camilo and tells him the story of her incredible life. Violeta was born in 1920 in the midst of the Spanish Flu epidemic which like everywhere else ravages Chile and she will die in 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic, a strangely symmetrical coincidence of a life circle completed. It’s an amazing story of riches to rags following the 1929 Wall Street Crash and her family’s exile from the capital to Nahuel in the south of Chile where she blossoms. She tells of her loves and losses, her marriages, her passionate affairs one of which has a brutal element to it but which gave her children and her grandson Camilo, ‘her greatest love’. It charts her success as an astute business woman, we view women’s rights, political rights through which there’s a snapshot of Chile’s dramatic changes which have been well documented in her books and in others. The historical context is superb, it’s written with real clarity and includes stories of great bravery such as that of Albert Benoit.\\n\\nThis is a beautifully written, intense, dramatic sweeping saga of a colourful life well lived through some astounding events and I love every word of it. It’s written in the typical Allende visual style so you can see the characters and events spring to life before your eyes which simply enthrals me. The quality of the writing and the story of Violeta leads to a multitude of emotions as her highs are yours and the lows are deeply felt. I love the moments of humour but there’s also the other end of the scale with personal darkness for Violeta, for Chile and the world. The characterisation is fantastic, all are exceptionally well crafted and you get a strong sense of the personalities springing from the pages. The settings are beautiful especially Nahuel (google it, it’s absolutely stunning!) and there are some wonderful descriptions. I especially like the indigenous element which is extremely powerful especially the spirituality which plays an important role in the storytelling.\\n\\nOverall, I’ve read most of Isabel Allende’s books and in my opinion she’s one of the best authors around as she never fails to take me on a literary journey. This one is spellbinding, captivating and absorbing and is storytelling at its best. What a beautiful cover too, matching the contents.\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Bloomsbury Publishing PLC for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.',\n",
       " 'I can say now that I finally know what people mean when they say they\\'re relieved a book is over. It\\'s been an exhausting read, something I\\'d not have ever imagined to say about an Isabel Allende book, an author I used to love so much but ended up hating when she became repetitive and formulaic, always churning out samey storylines and characters, and obsessively returning again and again to the one that made her famous, The House of the Spirits.\\n\\nIt was completionism what made me break my very long avoidance of her latest books; I heard this was based on Allende\\'s mother and the protagonist was named del Valle, the same family from her stellar first novel that also reappear in two other novels that make an unintended trilogy. and . I didn\\'t have high expectations, honestly, I learnt long ago to not expect much from Allende, just a need to know what else there was to tell about the del Valle clan. For those who are curious about what the connection between this novel and the two others is,\\n\\n\\nI feel such utter exhaustion just from thinking what to write as criticism, so I\\'ll be brief: Isabel Allende is fixated on the same kind of characters and the same kind of anecdotes, and keeps repeating the same plots and events over and over in different novels, as if she has nothing original left to say. And it\\'s so tiresome for those who\\'ve read more than two books by her, because we soon notice how utterly unoriginal and repetitive she is. This novel is supposed to be a homage to her mother, but instead of writing the actual story of her mother, which would\\'ve been original content, Allende just took the same bits and pieces from her other novels to create Violeta, and the other characters, even when she claims the inspiration are new people, are again repetitive. The character of Nieves, for example, has appeared in other novels already, with different names. Why? Because Allende can\\'t think of anything original and recycles the tragic drug-addicted daughters of her ex-husband, whose life she\\'s also exploited for novels before and keeps doing so, as if no reader will ever notice the insulting repetition. The complaint I\\'ve seen from other reviewers about feeling like they\\'ve read this novel before is 100% warranted and correct, because it frankly is.\\n\\nAnd Allende isn\\'t even bothering to at least put more effort into her writing, which has lost quality and not just due to age. She gives the impression that she doesn\\'t write for the love of writing anymore but due to habit, because it\\'s January 8th again and she must write something, no matter if it\\'s crap. She herself admitted as much in one interview to a Spanish-language newspaper where she said that when she sits down to write every January 8th, she thinks \"I\\'ll write a bad book, and if it\\'s garbage, I\\'ll sort it out afterwards.\" Well, she didn\\'t sort this one out, because it\\'s still garbage, and I say that with a sorrowful and disappointed heart.\\n\\nAnd because I read this in Spanish, there\\'s no \"lost in translation\" excuse I could cling to. It\\'s simply a lazily-written book with recycled plots, meaningless detours aplenty, and horridly unlikable main characters that are also recycled, and that\\'s it. At least I can say I honoured my following the del Valle saga till the bitter end, and I\\'ll always love the other novels, especially , although I\\'m not sure I can count this one as part of the saga.',\n",
       " 'The year is 1920, in an unnamed country in South America. Violeta is born into Del Valles family with five boys, a father who takes risky ventures, and mother who refuses to socialize.\\n\\nVioleta relates her story in a form of a letter to someone she dearly loves. Through her eyes, we see dramatic changes in a span of one person’s lifetime. When the stock market crashes in September 1929, her father’s bold decisions leave the family in a dire situation. The oldest son, Jose Antonio, turns out to be the rock of the family, taking the lead and responsibility to provide for the family.\\n\\nVioleta’s is the character of a woman who exemplifies a life lived to the fullest, despite all the challenges life serves her. And it brings quite many of them. She lives through political revolutions, tyranny, economic downfalls, and the natural disasters of earthquakes and pandemics. She is born into privilege, and with the Great Depression she tastes poverty, while being quick at adapting to circumstances. Some of her remaining spoiled traits are eradicated completely by farm work and participation in teaching basics to children in remote areas. As a young woman, she shows the ability to make money, while being prudent, careful and calculated - the opposite of her father. She marries a good man, but passion drives her to another, at times, causing her to lose her good judgement. She experiences motherhood with its blissful moments as well as some heartbreaks, including resentment of her own child.\\n\\nAs with all Isabel Allende’s work, the characters are richly textured and set against vivid historical background. The heartfelt writing authentically reflects the lives of Latin American people with a heroine, who is flawed, makes good decisions to prosper herself and her family, but struggles with making the right decisions when it comes to love. The story vividly illustrates a lifetime set during turbulent times, when one’s life’s circumstances can change in a blink of an eye and how one can still rise time and time again.\\n\\nIt is an inspiring story of a woman who lives her life passionately, and despite the challenging times for women of her time, she still lives it on her own terms.\\n\\nThere is a mystery set in regards to location. The exact country in South America is not stated. However, the geographical descriptions and historical facts give hints where it might be happening.\\n\\nReview originally posted at mysteryandsuspense.com',\n",
       " '4.5 stars, rounded up\\nThis is only my second book by Isabel Allende, but once again I was entranced. She manages to weave personal stories into the details of the time and place.\\nVioleta is 100 years old and is writing out the story of her life for her grandson. Starting with the Spanish Flu, which hit Chile in 1920, the story progresses through the Great Depression, The Cuban Revolution, the Chilean military dictatorship and all the major stories of the 20th century. It was interesting to learn how those major events affected the country. “It’s a strange symmetry that I was born in one pandemic and will die in another.”\\nVioleta was a fascinating woman. She starts as a child of privilege, but after her father loses everything, she’s forced to learn to make due in a rural setting in a remote part of the country. She’s got a wild streak, a desire to do and see it all, to be her own woman. She’s also a passionate woman. She was so realistic I had to remind myself not to be so distressed by her often violent relationship with Julian Bravo, her lover of many years.\\nIt’s a fine line with historical fiction between making us truly see the time and place rather than just telling the reader. Allende walks that line, doing a fabulous balancing act.\\nMy thanks to Netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book.',\n",
       " '\"There is no greater power on this earth than story.\" (Libba Bray)\\n\\nIsabel Allende stands among the best of the best when it comes to portraying stories that grip you hard and then soften like sheer down. Violeta is long in its telling. Allende is detailed in leaving no stone unturned in describing political upheaval and presenting the deep cuts of loss. She hunches your shoulders over every petal and over every thorn. She frustrates you, at times, with the unending throngs of characters around every corner. And then, she swiftly brings you to your knees with the rawness of a carved cross bearings names.\\n\\nVioleta was born in an unnamed country in South America in 1920 just after the Great War. Her beginnings reflect what lies ahead. Her mother has had numerous miscarriages and has delivered five sons before Violeta. Her father, Arsenio Del Valle, dismisses the birth even if it bears a daughter. He is engulfed in his shady business deals until the Stock Market and the world-wide Great Depression drains the family fortune.\\n\\nWith no other recourse, the Del Valle family leaves the city to avoid the scandals. They travel to Nahuel, a small farming community reached by train. It is here that Violeta learns to make do with the barest of necessities. With her mother and her two aunts, she and her older brother, Jose Antonio, forge ahead in life. Jose Antonio gravitates toward the good things he learned from his wayward father. He establishes a lumber company and opens the door to a better life.\\n\\nIsabel Allende creates a panoramic view of the life of Violeta. She is strongly opinionated, relentless in her beliefs, but lacks a \"pause\" button. We will experience Violeta\\'s inner compass always pointing her in the wrong direction. When it comes to men, she trips over the most jagged of rocks. Her life swings unbalanced when she comes under the spell of a pilot she met one afternoon. The course of her life will be forever changed and that of her two children, Nieves and Juan Martin. We will experience heartwrenching events during these years.\\n\\nAnd yet, Violeta was especially carved precisely for her zealous inroads into women\\'s rights at a time and in a culture where such things did not exist. She stood her ground under the most trying of circumstances. Allende will set her story down in so many locations: Miami, Las Vegas, California, and finally Norway. And each time we will see awkward and ill-advised decisions coming from Violeta.....sometimes too late and sometimes too little. But this complicated woman will draw you in again and again. Isabel Allende sees to it.\\n\\nI received a copy of this novel through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to Random House (Ballantine Books) and to the highly talented Isabel Allende.',\n",

She lives an affluent life until the Great Depression and her family suffers immeasurable losses.\\n\\nThe only thing to do is to move on, and start over in a quieter, remote area where she will mature, grow, have a suitor, and begin a life full of many triumphs and sorrows.

She has lived a full and long life.\\n\\nIsabel Allende blew me away with . It was the first book I have ever read by her many years ago and it is still my favorite.

The best feeling I can get out of my reading experiences. 🧘\\u200d♀️\\nVioleta is one of those novels that gave me this feeling.\\n\\n💬An epic storytelling by Isabel Allende of melodramatic lives in a highly evocative, emotionally consuming and loving way embedding elements of magical realism. Sometimes she serves the cliché of Latin America with a meshwork of mafia and decadence, but it was an unarguable fit to the overall historical fiction, which I read with great pleasure.\\n\\n🥂Cheers to the one and only Violeta who lived an unforgettable life from 1920 to 2020 filled with passion, lust, love, ambivalence, doubts, and fears.\\n\\n📚Whilst this novel has been my first read by Allende, it won’t be my last one.\\n\\n🌟Highly recommended!🌟 Easy 5 stars!',\n",
       " 'Já imaginou ler a história de alguém que nasceu em meio a gripe espanhola, na década de 20, e viveu para testemunhar o mundo paralisado pela pandemia em pleno 2020? Bom, é justamente essa linha de tempo contemplada por “Violeta” que, ainda por cima, conta com a escrita fantasiosa de Allende.\\n\\nSão diversos os momentos históricos que a autora atravessa por meio de seu último livro (best seller em diversos países). Violeta del Valle foi a primeira garota em uma família repleta de meninos. Talvez esse fato tenha tornado Violeta uma mulher que sempre buscava se destacar no ambiente em que vivia. Mas essa tarefa não foi fácil, e nem sempre bem sucedida. Tendo nascido no início do século XX, Violeta vivenciou passagens históricas que afetaram sua trajetória. Ao leitor, toda essa intensa narrativa é apresentada por meio de uma carta dedicada a Camilo, uma figura que até então desconhecemos.\\n\\nEnquanto ainda criança, a protagonista teve que deixar a vida das cidades e se “refugiar” em um local isolado do país, que não nos é especificado por Allende, tudo como forma de proteção do pai contra a grande crise financeira que afetou o mundo no ano de 1929. E é nesse ambiente rodeado por natureza, com a presença de descendentes de povos indígenas e sob a tutoria de uma jovem europeia que Violeta cresce.\\n\\nA escrita é bem fluida e gostosa de ler, como é de se esperar dos livros de Allende. Confesso que no meio do livro o ritmo acaba ficando mais lento, mas a autora consegue recuperá-lo na última parte. Talvez isso até seja proposital, já que a autora pretendia mostrar como tantos acontecimentos históricos vão acontecendo em uma vida de alguém aparentemente comum, que não é a heroína, nem a vilã de uma história. Violeta é uma mulher que vive seus amores, sofre suas perdas e questiona injustiças que passam à sua frente.\\n\\nNesse ponto, achei bem interessante como a autora aborda algumas questões sociais relevantes sobre as quais nunca havia lido nada tão específico em seus outros romances. É o sinal de que alguns assuntos não podem ficar de lado nos tempo em que vivemos! Leitura que recomendo para todo mundo!\\n\\nNota 9/10\\n\\nLeia mais resenhas em',\n",

During those hundred years, there is the upheaval of the Great Depression, marriage to someone she doesn’t love and a long-lasting but emotionally and sometimes physical abusive affair to a man she does. She has children and makes money, but it’s difficult for her to control her money because she’s a female.\\n\\nThemes of women being able to control when they give birth and controlling what money they can earn permeate her hundred years on Earth.

       " 'I have long admired Isabel Allende’s gift for superior and epic storytelling. Violeta may just be her greatest accomplishment to date. As soon as I began reading Violeta I found that I was transported to another time and place. Once again, Isabel Allende wrote about a strong female protagonist. The female protagonist, Violeta Del Valle, possessed the qualities of independence, superior intellect and common sense, compassion, kindness, good business sense and the ability to make sound decisions. These qualities made this female protagonist, Violeta Del Valle, stand out and shine among men and women of her time. She was a woman that was independent and a woman ahead of the times she lived through. Violeta Del Valle lived to see her one hundredth birthday. In her day, women were expected to marry, keep house and have babies. That was not the life Violeta saw for herself and she would not think of settling.\\n\\nVioleta Del Valle was born in the year 1920 somewhere in South America. She was the only girl child in her family. Her mother had had five sons before Violeta was born. Everyone was ecstatic to welcome a girl into their family. Violeta had a mind of her own that stemmed back to the time of her birth. She grew up spoiled, often displayed temper tantrums if she didn’t get what she wanted and received little guidance about acceptable behavior from anyone in her family. It was no wonder that her father sought to hire a tutor for Violeta to teach her etiquette and proper behavior. Miss Josephine Taylor was hired and became a strong influence on shaping Violeta’s character and determination. The two women learned so much from each other and continued to keep in touch, see each other and seek advice and counsel from each other long after Miss Taylor was Violeta’s tutor.\\n\\nVioleta grew up during the Spanish Influenza and survived only to live through Covid years later. She and her family were greatly affected by the Great Depression which altered their lives in ways not one of them could have predicted. Violeta lived through World War II, the Cuban Revolution and the upheavals in the government of Chile. Violeta disclosed the saga of her life in an ongoing letter to Camilo, someone that she cared for a great deal. Violeta revealed how she abandoned her first marriage for a pilot she fell hopelessly in love with. She finally admitted and came to the realization that she was abused both physically and mentally in that relationship. Years later, that impressionable part of her life led Violeta to start a foundation to aid women that were victims of domestic violence.\\n\\nVioleta lived through significant times in history. Isabel Allende magnificently wrote about the courage Violeta had to possess in order to be able to stand up to what she believed in. Her life was rich, colorful and mostly fulfilling. It did have its set backs and challenges but through it all Violeta became stronger. I believe that perhaps her main regret was not having a better relationship with her son and daughter. I did not want this book to end, it was so well written and impeccably researched. I highly recommend this book.\\n\\nThank you to Ballantine Books for allowing me to read the digital version of Violeta by Isabel Allende through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.',\n",
       " '4.5/5\\n\\nIsabel Allende\\'s latest masterpiece, Violeta, is a chronicle of a woman\\'s life sweeping across a century of history, written in epistolary form.\\n\\n\"There is a time to live and a time to die .In between there\\'s a time to remember.\"\\n\\nIn her last days, Violeta Del Valle writes a letter to her grandson Camilo divulging in great detail the story of her life, spanning almost one hundred years starting with her birth in 1920 in the midst of the Spanish flu pandemic to 2020 when the world is being ravaged by another pandemic. Having lived through and been directly affected by the Great Depression, WW2 and political upheaval in her home country and around the world, her life has been an eventful one, to say the least.\\n\\nAbandoning her devoted husband to be with her lover, conceiving 2 children out of wedlock and embarking on building her own career fueled by her own ambition and refusing to conform to the strictures imposed by restrictive societal norms, Allende\\'s Violeta is a strong and willful woman who lives life on her own terms, makes mistakes and learns from them , takes responsibility for her own fate and reinvents herself every step of the way while gathering much wisdom in the course of her long eventful life. In many ways she is a woman who is way ahead of her time. Her story is one of family and friendship ,her many loves, loss and setbacks, courage and ambition. More importantly,in Violeta, the author portrays a woman with the indomitable will to survive , grow and prosper in the backdrop of volatile political climate , changing societal landscape and personal tragedy and upheaval.\\n\\nIsabel Allende\\'s prose is elegant and a joy to read. Among the strong female influences in Violeta\\'s life, the characters of Aunt Pilar, Facunda, Teresa Rivas and her family and Miss Taylor are superbly crafted. Strong characters and masterful storytelling are typical of Isabel Allende\\'s novels and in Violeta she does not disappoint.\\n\\nThanks to NetGalley, the author and the publisher for providing an eARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.',\n",

Sin atisbo de pedantería, digresiones superfluas o grandes disertaciones nos cuenta las vicisitudes de la vida de una mujer que logra llegar a los cien años: desde su nacimiento en la plaga de la gripe española en 1920, hasta la reciente pandemia del coronavirus en 2020.

En mi opinión, esta última parte predomina sobre la primera que finalmente queda relegada a simple marco temporal. no es una crónica novelada del siglo XX, es un homenaje a la lucha de una mujer por poder vivir su propia vida, por lograr alcanzar su independencia.\\n\\nQuizá le falta algo más de actitud crítica ante la cantidad de barbaridades que describe (entre ellas guerras, crisis económicos o cruentas dictaduras) y quizá también unos personajes menos entrañables (aunque la narración en primera persona epistolar sin duda ayuda a empatizar con la protagonista y con aquellos que describe). De todos modos, parece quedar claro que Allende no busca polemizar. Al final, termina siendo un canto a la vida en todas sus facetas, a la pureza de los afectos, a la solidaridad, a la simplicidad de las cosas, a la aceptación del paso del tiempo: nunca es demasiado tarde para ser feliz.\\n\\nes una narración fresca y ligera, una historia viva que no decae en ningún momento, que me ha entretenido, que muchas veces me ha emocionado y que alguna otra me ha hecho sonreír.',\n",

How does one do what one knows is best without crossing the line? Civil Townsend, a 23-year-old nurse in the Montgomery Alabama of 1973 has to figure all that out. Working for a federally funded family planning clinic, Civil is one of several nurses responsible for administering Depo-Provera shots to young women patients. The Williams family is her first case. They live in a cabin that is little more than a shack on a farmer’s property, Mace, the father, Mrs Williams, his mother, and two girls, Erica and India. Civil does her job, but after having administered the shots learns that neither eleven-year-old India nor thirteen-year-old Erika has had her first period. In fact, neither of the girls has even kissed a boy yet. So why are they receiving birth-control shots? She learns as well that there are questions about the safety of the shots, which had been found to cause cancer in test animals. She starts looking into what might be done about this.\\n\\n\\n- image from American University\\n\\nCivil has the hard-charging enthusiasm of a rookie, eager to do all in her power to help those in need. Her background is nothing like that of her patients. Her father is a doctor, and her mother an artist. They raised her to do good, even named her for their aspirations of achieving civil rights for black people.\\n\\nCivil does everything she can to help the family, gets them some public services, a decent place to live, schooling. And she has an impact, but, on a day when Civil is not working, the head nurse at the clinic tricks the family into signing papers agreeing to the girls’ sterilization. Civil’s alarm turns to rage, and then to fighting for change, so this outrage can never happen again to other unsuspecting girls and young women.\\n\\nIt is 1973, only a year since the infamous, forty-years-long Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment was finally shut down. In that one, hundreds of black men were supposedly being treated for syphilis, but in fact no one was being treated. Of the four hundred who were diagnosed with the disease, one hundred died of syphilis directly or complications from the disease. Dozens of wives were infected, and children were born already afflicted. All this, to see how syphilis ran its course in the untreated.\\n\\nCivil’s activity gets a lawsuit started locally. But soon a young civil rights lawyer, Lou Feldman, is brought in. He transforms it into a national , as the case shifts from looking at the individual harm done to the Williams family to the national disgrace of the forced sterilization of tens thousands.\\nHe wants the laws changed, to end this practice. It is a huge concern for the Black community, but the novel makes clear that there were other groups who were victimized by this heinous practice.\\n\\nThe story take place in two, very unequal timelines. The frame is Civil at sixty-seven, a doctor in 2016, returning to Montgomery after a long absence to see the Williams girls. India is dying. This offers us an ongoing where-are-they-now report. The bulk of the novel takes place in 1973 and immediately after.\\n\\nCivil struggles with her guilt over having played a part in this horror. It is clear that the notions that had supported legislators allowing such things were not entirely unfamiliar. Civil talks with Lou about the history of eugenics.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerkins-Valdez offers a most welcome maturity of perspective. Lou, a young, white lawyer, is viewed with suspicion to begin, but earns the community’s trust with his dedication, brilliance, grueling work habits, and effectiveness. He is lauded as a hero, while Mrs Seager, the head nurse, is shown as a flawed person who, though she was doing something terrible, thought she was doing the right thing. Characters take or avoid difficult decisions for understandable reasons. Even a black Tuskegee librarian whom Civil admires has a hard time understanding how she did not see what was going on right under her nose. There is very little good vs evil going on here in the character portrayals, only in the broader horror of a dark-hearted, racist and classist policy.\\n\\nOne of the many joys of the book is the portrayal of a time and place. There are details that add to the touch and feel.\\nSome are more cultural, like the perceptions middle class black people in Montgomery had of poor black people, and the less fraught parallel football culture in which Alabama vs Auburn, followed by white people, is replaced for the black population with Alabama A&M vs Alabama State. News to me. We also get a taste of the segregation of the time, how bathroom accessibility while on the road could be problematic for those of the wrong skin color, how a beach that used to be open to all, and featured black-owned businesses, now required one to pay a park ranger and display a piece of paper on your car, the businesses now long gone.\\n\\nThe case on which Perkins-Valdez based her novel was a real one, Relf vs Weinberger, filed in July, 1973 in Washington D.C. by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Joseph Levin, one of the Center’s founders, was the young lawyer who prosecuted the case.\\nThe story ultimately is about the horror of forced sterilization on poor black people and other classes deemed unfit to breed. You will learn a lot about a crime against humanity that was perpetrated by our own government, and the story of how this injustice was fought. But if the story does not engage, you may not get the benefit of the new knowledge it delivers. Thankfully, there need be no concern on that score. While we may echo the commentary of others to Civil that she did not bear any responsibility for what was done, that her guilt was helping no one, here is a very full-bodied portrait, of a flawed character. One who makes mistakes. A young person who has not yet learned when to push forward, when to take a step back. We see her learning this and can applaud when she takes steps in the proper direction. We also get to see the difficult family dynamic she must negotiate with her own parents, the burden of expectation that has been fitted to her broad shoulders, and the challenge of loving the Williams family, but not too much. And we have a front row seat to her relationships, her struggles, with friends and colleagues.\\n\\nis a wonderful addition to the Perkins-Valdez oeuvre, begun with her outstanding 2009 novel, , and followed by in 2015. She has a fourth in the works, due to her publisher in October 2022, set in early 1900s North Carolina. So maybe a 2023 release?\\n\\nA helping hand is often that, kindly meant, but maybe, sometimes, before you put your hand in another’s, you might want to know where it has been, and where it might be taking you. If the hand is attached to Dolen Perklins-Valdez, grasp it and hold on.

       " 'The immoral and shameful overreach of the U.S. government on the reproductive rights of mostly black and poor women and young girls through forced sterilization is the central focus of this novel told in dual time lines ,1973 and 2016. While these events are mainly told through the experiences of two young black girls aged 11 and 14 and the nurse who tries to save them, there were many other women in the country subjected to these immoral practices at that time. Even in more recent years, “reproductive injustice “ took place in California prisons between 2006 and 2010.\\n\\nThis is not just a story that enlightened me, stunned me, educated me, but one that moved me, bringing me to tears thinking about these young girls and women. Taking real events as the inspiration and giving a portrait of the time and place and the emotional and psychological impact on people’s lives is for me a hallmark of good historical fiction. The author in her note indicates what of this novel is based on real events and real people and that made it all the more meaningful. Sad and scary and infuriating how relevant this overreach is even today.\\n\\nI received a copy of this book from Berkley through NetGalley and Edelweiss.',\n",
       " '“There’s no greater right for a woman than having a choice .”\\n\\nWe follow the life of Civil Townsend, a nurse, who is assigned to two girls called India and Erica. Civil grew up a bit more privileged than most black families in Alabama, but still sees the many disparities in the healthcare system for black families and is hoping to do as much as she can for these girls and their family. She soon becomes more than their nurse, as she takes care of their grooming, education, and even their living conditions. Something really sad and really hard to take in happens to them around halfway through the book, and it stirs up hard conversations about the state of healthcare among certain communities.\\n\\nAmazing, heartbreaking, and inspirational story!! This one had me crying those really silent, calm tears instead of the intense sobbing some books put me through. This is loosely based on a true story about the lives of two black girls, Mary Alice and Minnie Lee Rolf. Don’t google them yet if you don’t want spoilers. This book exposes many things that you might not necessarily hear about if you’re not actively trying to discover what healthcare was and is like for certain communities. The girls and the family really illustrate what many poor and minority communities lack, including basic things they should know about their health and illiteracy. The distrust these communities have with the system is also clearly disclosed. Civil Townsend is an exceptional character. She truly fell in love with this family, and what happened to them literally affects her for her entire life. We see this because the book travels to the future in which who she is now is clearly a reflection of the past. I also like that we learn a lot about her, her past struggles, and the people she is closest to enough for us to connect to her individually as much as we are connecting to the story. We also engage with the law quite a bit more than halfway through the story.\\n\\n“Because history repeats what we don’t remember.”\\nThe story is definitely one that captures your heart and keeps you going. This rightly made me angry and sad at certain points, but I definitely felt an overwhelming sense of peace by the end. Some people in this story took very courageous steps that didn’t pay off exactly as we wanted, but it was definitely something. I just want to be this brave to call out bullshit anyway I can. This is one of those books you can feel is going to be 5 stars early on in the book. At this point, the only way I want to learn about history is through books like these. Nurses truly are such an integral part of medicine!!!',\n",
       " \"In her newest novel, Dolen Perkins-Valdez probes the many ways institutional racism and classism inflicts lasting scars, especially on young Black women--and the grace, courage, and love necessary to begin to heal those wounds. Deeply empathetic yet unflinching in its gaze, TAKE MY HAND is an unforgettable exploration of responsibility and redemption, the dangers of good intentions, and the folly of believing anyone can decide what's best for another's life.\",\n",
       " 'Alabama 1973.\\nHistory tells us the south was backwards in more ways than one. This story sadly speaks of some of the shameful truths.\\n\\nCivil Townsend has graduated. A black nurse who wants to make a difference in the community.\\nHer first job is one at a family planning clinic. A place that provides birth control to girls and women. She gets attached to two of the girls, discovers they are dosing them with a drug not even FDA approved. Then worse things are revealed.\\n\\nWhat’s appalling is how these females were treated inhumanely. Innocence violated. Those in positions making life decisions for those in “their” care. Low income, of African descent, illiterate.\\n\\nThe story is beautifully written. Told in parallel from then to now. Civil’s own personal history patterns and growth. Guilt and redemption. Trying to correct a wrong. Recognizing that family isn’t defined by blood.\\n\\nThe history in the US again is on shaky political grounds. Women’s rights on abortion about to be made illegal. What’s next? If the Supreme Court overturns the Roe vs Wade ruling, the country takes a step backward. I’m not pro abortion but I am pro choice*\\n\\n5⭐️',\n",
       " '5 stars!\\n\\n“In a world inundated by information about these tragedies and more, I still passionately believe in the power the novel (and its readers!) to raise the alarm, influence hearts, and impact lives.” ~ Dr. Dolen Perkins-Valdez\\n\\n^I can’t say it any better, so I had to quote it. Loosely inspired by actual events, Take My Hand is the powerful story of two young Black sisters who were victims of reproductive injustice, without the informed consent of their caregivers or the girls. It’s also the story of their nurse who was working at the family planning clinic at the time.\\n\\nIt is not ok that this ever happened to women, teenagers, young girls, women with disabilities, women who were economically disadvantaged, women in prison, women in institutional living, and to find out that it continues to happen? That leads me right back to the quote above.\\n\\nI devoured this book in two days. The writing is smooth and precise; the story compelling and never loses pace. You can’t help but love India and Erica, who at first live in extreme poverty after their mother has passed away, their father and grandmother doing the best they can at the time, still grieving. Their nurse, Civil, becomes close to the family, and eventually becomes an advocate for them, finding them more secure, livable housing, a job for the father, schools for the girls, and eventually, on the path to justice when the unthinkable happens to these girls and this family.\\n\\nA thought-provoking, important, sensitively told novel everyone should read.\\n\\nI received a gifted copy.\\n\\nMany of my reviews can also be found on my blog: and instagram:',\n",
       " 'Most folks have heard of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. But not as well known is the US’s forced sterilization of poor young black girls. And I’m not talking about the early 20th century, but the 1960s and 70s.\\nThis book is based on a true story, as told from the perspective of a black doctor. Civil Townsend was a nurse in the 1970s, working for a birth control clinic in Montgomery, Alabama. She firmly believes in helping women control the when and ifs of becoming pregnant. But those running the clinic have other ideas.\\nShe later becomes a doctor and the story is told from a dual timeline approach. The second time is 2016, as Civil attempts to explain to her daughter what happened.\\nPerkins-Valdez does a great job wrapping the facts of the time into an interesting story. She meets my goal of historical fiction being a source of education. It’s an incredibly sad story. It deals not only with government overreach, but with the slippery slope that can occur when someone believes they know what’s best for someone else and takes matters into their own hand.\\nThis would make a great book club selection.\\nMy thanks to Netgalley and Berkley for an advance copy of this book.',\n",
       " \"An important story and a shameful past.\\n\\nTake My Hand is an unforgettable story inspired by true events of the Relf sisters.\\n\\nThe novel is told in two timelines by Civil Townsend in 1963 and 2016. Civil is a new nurse and works at the Montgomery Family Planning Clinic. After a nurse quit, Civil was assigned to the Williams sisters aged thirteen and eleven. She was to continue administering Depo-Provera, a contraception shot to the girls both so young and have never been with a boy. Civil believe it was not the right thing to do and decided not to give them any shots. Her action or inaction led to an inhumane irreversible path for the girls.\\n\\nThis book was very moving and difficult to read. I did enjoy the first half immensely. Perkins-Valdez did a wonderful job portraying the characters and setting. Unfortunately, I found the second half to drag on too much that I skimmed a lot of it.

       " 'Take My Hand is a gem of a read! It reminds us just how important it is for these stories to be told, for them to be heard, to be acknowledged and remembered and to care; that feels crucial right now. This is why I read the books I do!!\\n\\n“In order to heal, we must remember, once we remember we must acknowledge, and once we acknowledge we can take more significant action.” ~ Dolen Perkins-Valdez\\n\\nWhat are some of the themes explore? Did the stories have me think deeply, challenge my thoughts, and see something different? Or learn anything new?\\n\\nYES!!! It is a moving, meaningful, less-known story that explores reproductive rights and justice for black people. The story is inspired by real-life 12 and 14 years old sisters Mary Alice and Minnie Lee Relf. A federally funded family planning clinic involuntarily sterilized them in Montgomery, Alabama 1973. While this case has been well publicized, it is not well known or been written about.\\n\\n\\nOther themes of responsibility, redemption and unintentionally wounds are explored through Civil. Civil is a young privileged black woman out of nursing school and working at the Montgomery Family Planning Clinic. She is assigned to give birth control shots to two black Alabama sisters, 13-year-old Erica and 11-year-old India. She starts to question why the birth control shots are given to the girls and discovers they are potentially harmful.\\n\\nSense of place and time\\n\\nDolen Perkins-Valdez captures an affecting sense of place and time with the Roe v. Wade decision a few months earlier, women had the right to abortion, and the U.S. government’s Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the black males. She brings a part of the past to light. With Roe v Wade set to be overturned and reproductive rights in parts of the U.S. are being threatened and oppressed, it’s timely and relevant.\\n\\nI am Canadian, and abortions are regulated similar to other healthcare procedures across Canadian provinces. Through the Canada Health Act, Canadians have a right to access sexual and reproductive health services, including abortion.\\n\\nThe characters:Are the characters easy to connect and relate to? Was I able to step into their shoes?\\n\\nWhile Perkins-Valdez uses the savior trope, she writes with compassion and creates realistic characters that are easy to relate to and connect with. She creates an extraordinary, affecting character with Civil, who becomes consumed with helping the Williamses family. She becomes aware that she has unintentionally wounded the family and battles her demons for her part in the girls’ involutnating sterilization. It’s easy to step into the characters’ shoes and feel with them.\\n\\n“Sometimes love can kill you, just like hate. You love too hard, and you can lose yourself in other folks’ sorrow. You hate too hard, and you know the rest of that story.” ~ Civil\\n\\n“had never known that good intentions could be just as destructive as bad ones.” ~ Civil\\n\\nWhat were some of the emotions I experienced while reading this one?\\n\\nI had an array of emotions; the best thing about that was I felt them along with Civil. I felt confused and disbelief about what was happening to Erica and India and then angry that it did happen. I had all kinds of questions I needed answers to. I was rooting for Civil to find some peace with her part of what happened. I felt for the Williams family and felt their pain, and rooted for their fight. I felt sad to see how poor, uneducated black families are in the system, a system that should be there to protect them, not cause harm. I was inspired by Civil’s kindness, her willingness to help the Williams, and her decision to stand up and give a voice to the family.\\n\\n“Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.”\\n\\nI highly recommend reading it!!\\n\\nI received a copy from the publisher.',\n",

       " 'This is the Modern Mrs Darcy Book Club May 2023 selection. Dolen Perkins-Valdez will join us for a discussion on May 23!\\n\\nA timely and gripping work of historical fiction loosely inspired by the real-life groundbreaking court case of Relf v Weinberger. In 2016 Memphis, distinguished Black doctor Civil Townsend prepares to retire. First she must journey to her hometown of Montgomery to make peace with the past and tell the truth of it to her own daughter. In alternating timelines, Civil reveals all that unfolded in 1973, when she was a young and idealistic nurse, stepping into her first job at a reproductive clinic serving Black women in her community. She cared deeply for the girls under her care, but grew alarmed at what she was called upon to do: administer experimental and perhaps unnecessary treatments to young patients without their understanding or consent. When the unthinkable happens to one patient and she is sterilized without consent, Civil becomes involved in a landmark lawsuit. A moving story and a testament to fiction’s power to influence hearts and impact lives.',\n",
       " '4.5 rounded up.\\n\\nThis powerful novel is based on a true story with the central character being Civil Townsend and is told in two timelines. The first is 1973 when she’s a nurse and newly employed by the Montgomery family planning clinic which takes her to the Williams farm where she is to administer Depo-Provera to Erica aged 13 and India aged 11. These girls live in terrible poverty in a one room cabin, neither have ever kissed a boy never mind anything else and one of them is incredibly young. The second timeline is 2016 and Civil is now a doctor considering retirement and is trying to come to terms with what unfolds in 1973 but some things are just too big to ever leave behind .\\n\\nThis is an emotional and incredibly sad tale which the author tells well. Although I knew some things about the eugenics program (it’s also covered in Necessary Lies by Diane Chamberlain) but the author fills in a lot of details I don’t know such as Depo-Provera. These girls are almost lab rats as at the time it’s not even FDA approved. Civil tries to do good, to do what she believes is the right thing which she will come to regret bitterly. The novel starts slowly but builds as a horrifying tale emerges evoking a whole range of feelings. There are some courtroom scenes that are utterly riveting, the pathos of the girls situation strikes a heartbreaking unforgettable blow.\\n\\nThis is one book you won’t forget in a hurry and nor should it be so as it’s deeply profound and tragic raising a multitude of questions not least on human rights. It’s compelling, raw, disturbing and very well written as the two timelines flow very well, weaving the past with present.\\n\\nThis book led me to some additional reading especially on the Relf versus Weinberger case of 1973 and on the early use of Depo-Provera and any book that leads you to further research has to be worth reading in my opinion.\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Orion for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.',\n",
       " '4 stars!\\n\\nAn eye-opening, informative, heartbreaking story exploring the US government forced sterilization policies targeted mainly at poor, Black girls and women in post-segregation Alabama in the 1970’s.\\n\\nCivil Townsend is a nurse at a family planning clinic in Montgomery, Alabama. She has two young patients who are sisters (11 and 13 years old) who she becomes very attached to. Through her devotion to and advocacy for these young, uneducated sisters living in poverty, she discovers life-altering decisions being made for the girls by the government without properly informing them or their families.\\n\\nThis book is heavy — frustrating, poignant, devastating, emotional, hard-hitting. It is one that will leave an impact on every reader. The story shares a piece of history that is appalling to accept. It’s horrific to think the government controlled reproductive rights so boldly mainly in poor, uneducated communities. Often these sterilizations happened with no time to properly explain and inform the patients ahead of these life changing procedures. Sadly, in some parts of the world, reproductive rights remain a topic the government continues to try to control (but I am not here to get into that conversation).\\n\\nThe first half of the book was gut-wrenching and intense. I was glued to the pages and fully invested in the characters. My heart strings were pulled hard by these unique and endearing characters. The second half lost some of its grip on me which is why I took one star away. The courtroom scenes were not as intense or impactful as the rest of the book, although they were extremely important to the storyline — just not written in as powerful of a way as the beginning. Regardless of this, it is an important, relevant book that made a big impact on me as a whole. I learned a lot.\\n\\nI can compare this to Diane Chamberlain’s exceptional book, Necessary Lies. Another stunning novel surrounding forced sterilization and eugenics. I read that years ago and still think of it often. Highly recommend that if you want to explore further stories on this topic.\\n\\nThank you to my lovely local library for the loan!',\n",

       " \"Do you ever love a book, its story and a message it delivers, but you just cannot connect with the characters?\\n\\nThis happened to me with Take my Hand. Its a very important book - it taught me so much about events in Atlanta I have never heard of before. It its shocking and unbelievable, the length humans can go in their own prejudices and their will to use all the power and force to make their own sets of beliefs the right ones. I will never ever\\nget accustomed to it. I'm an idealist, I know. But I do believe that everyone is important and everyone has a right to its own choices.\\n\\nBut, off to what I minded. I just didn't get the emotions Id need from a book like this. I needed to cry, to get angry, to be more upset and unsettled. But even with realizing its importance and impact, I remained cold. I wanted more of the emotions from the characters themselves. More fire. More inner motives. It all seemed plastic and superficial and I just couldn't get past that. I am an emotional reader and even though I like my books informative, they still need to stir the emotions. The higher the better.\\n\\nBut thinking about it, maybe it was meant to be detached a little. To make our heads clearer so we can appreciate the message better. Make us more objective. More understanding. Maybe. I sure hope so.\",\n",

Every thought and feeling she has is so visceral and realistic; you feel every single emotion she does.\\n\\nis incredibly eye opening and educational. Like Ruta Sepetys, Doles Perkins-Valdez manages to shed a light on a relatively unknown part of history that more people should be aware of. While many historical fiction novels can feel outdated because the time period has passed, the disturbing fact that forced sterilization still occurs in the United States today makes this a relevant and informative read. In fact, one report discovered that “148 female prisoners in two California institutions were sterilized between 2006 and 2010” [].\\n\\nis a distressing but important read told with incredible empathy.

       " 'I deliberately avoided reading much about this novel before beginning and I gasped aloud when the pivotal event occurred. Given that this is a fictionalized account of actual events makes it even more horrifying. This novel is as much about good intentions resulting in unintended consequences as it is about gross injustices inflicted upon the poverty-stricken, black population in the deep south. The voice of the much older doctor, who is a nurse at the time of the event, is warm, authentic, and wise as she recounts her story and her reasons for a trip back to her hometown. Forty-eight years later our healthcare system is still a mess and racist not to neglect mentioning that abortion rights are being seriously threatened.',\n",

Without spoiling the plot, she portrays the past and still ongoing reproductive injustices faced by Black and brown, low-income, disabled, and otherwise marginalized girls and women.

       " 'This is a book that really has a powerful message. Civil Townsend is fresh out of nursing school and ready to make a difference at The Montgomery Alabama Family Planning Clinic. She is assigned to visit homes and give young girls shots of Depo Provera. This is a form of longer lasting birth control. She meets with two sisters, India, 11 and Erica, 13. They are black and poor. It is just assumed that this means they will be sexually active. India has not even gotten her period yet, so can’t get pregnant. Civil thinks she is helping, but starts to check into exactly what she is injecting these girls with. Things get much worse after this.\\n\\nI think the powerful message is if you know something is wrong, speak up. It is so much easier to be quiet or get pulled along with others who try to convince you that everything is being done correctly and for a reason. It is much harder to speak up and yes, there is a price to pay for doing so. Yet, I do not know of any acts of social injustice that get changed without someone refusing to keep quiet and knows it is necessary to bring about change so that is the motivation to say something.\\n\\nCivil is outraged by the cruelty toward India and Erica and really loves these girls. It is always hard to be the first to speak out and not tolerate horrendous acts, yet for Civil it is not a choice. She can’t drop this. She is not going to let these girls and their family be hurt anymore. I was incredibly moved by the courage Civil shows. This is how we make a difference, this is how we try in our flawed way to bring about change, and it was a tremendous book to read.\\n\\nIt will disturb you. It should disturb you. It will also inspire you. I read to remind myself that it is important to remember my role and to be brave and not allow injustice to continue because I am complacent. I think I should strive to be aware and leave the world a little better then when I stepped into it. Something to think about and this book certainly will make you do that. The author does an outstanding job and I can not recommend this book enough.',\n",

However, I have some complaints.\\n\\n1) Why couldn’t we just stick with the sterilization horror? Why did we have to add the main character having had an abortion? It muddied the waters, and took away from what the author was trying to teach us about (welfare forced sterilizations) by wasting time drawing connections between the two. Instead of delving into the horror of never being able to have children because some government entity tricked you into it (terrible!!) the author delved into how the main character had CHOSEN to have an abortion, and that the girls had never been given that CHOICE. It just felt so wacky to me, and detracted from the reality of two young black girls’ tubes being tied at 11 and 13 years old. Which leads me to my next complaint.\\n\\n2) I wish I had felt more! A terrible thing was done, but I felt so bleh about it. I wish we had gotten more emotion. Maybe some chapters from India or Erica’s points of view?

You should read the 1st book before reading this one, as many things are explained in that book, i.e., how the daughter came to be adopted and why her parents are in prison.\\nThe imagery in this book of rural Appalachian Kentucky is rich and evocative, bringing the reader into a land of stark beauty and isolation. The author describes the trials of Honey Lovett. She is the daughter of 2 people illegally married in the eyes of a cruel \"anti- miscegenation\" law, forbidding marriage between different races. These laws, mostly in the southern half of the US., were finally struck down in 1967 by the US Supreme Court in the Loving vs Virginia case.

       " '***Now available***\\n\\nThe Book Woman’s Daughter by Kim Michele Richardson is the sequel to The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek but it can also be read as a stand-alone. The story begins in 1953 when a blue woman with a rare blood disorder, Cussy Mary Carter Lovett, and her white husband, Jackson Lovett, are arrested and imprisoned for violating the miscegenation laws of Kentucky. Their sixteen-year-old adopted daughter, Honey, must evade the law and head back to Troublesome Creek to live with an elderly friend, Retta. If Honey does not escape, she will be confined to the Kentucky House of Reform, a children’s prison, where she will be forced to do hard labor until the age of twenty-one (21).\\n\\nThis is a story about strong women and the power of sisterhood. While still a teenager, Honey must grow up quickly and become a wage earner. She befriends other women including a frontier nurse, a young female forest fire lookout, and a female miner. As in most parts of the country in 1953, men dominated the workforce and treated working women unfairly. There are interesting side stories about Junia, a mule, and Tommy, a rooster, who protect their female owners. Additionally, light is shed on the terrible condition of the prisons and forced medical experiments and surgeries on patients. The author has clearly done her research in writing about these topics.\\n\\nThere were some things that I didn’t like as much about the story. First, even though the Pack Horse Librarian service had been discontinued in 1943, the Troublesome Creek Library happens to revive the project just as Honey arrived in town in need of a job. It was too coincidental. Second, the book occasionally felt like it was focused on man-hating. The story has a corrupt Sheriff, an unjust coal mine boss, and a prejudiced bully and his family who will stop at nothing to get their way. These bad guys were stereotypical and slightly over-the-top. At one point Honey says like all Kentucky women, she knows when to stand down to men. It is a means of survival taught to girls, instilled at a young age.\\n\\n4-stars. Many thanks to #Netgalley and SOURCEBOOKS Landmark for my advanced reader copy.

Starvation still kills more people than any influenza. And the laws are still racist, prohibiting mixed marriages, which includes the Blues. The book starts when Honey’s parents are both sent to jail for violating that law and Honey, age 16, is at the mercy of the court.\\nShe finds work as a packhorse librarian, the same job her mother had years earlier. Richardson again does a wonderful job capturing the time and place. The Kentucky hills are a hard place to survive. Books were one of the few enjoyments available. Coal is the primary source of employment. The story is a reminder that people tend to take out their frustrations on those they love. There’s a lot of domestic violence. There’s also violence against women that take what are considered “men’s jobs”. The characters are inspirational and endearing. The book is extremely well researched.

Cussy Mary\\'s people first came to Kentucky from France in 1820 with a rare blood disorder.

It’s early March, as the daughter of the original Book Woman, Honey Mary-Angeline Lovett, is now sixteen years old, looks back on those years, recalling the love and appreciation shown to her mother, and to her as she often accompanied her on her book route.\\n\\nWhen a peddler comes to their door, and notices her mother’s blue skin colour, he can’t help but mention it when he gets back to town. Knowing that the law will come to them at any moment, since Miscegenation laws were a tool used to get rid of those people who appeared physically to be ‘different,’ and therefore unwanted and unwelcome. Meanwhile, their daughter Honey is hiding in the cellar when the ‘law’ shows up, and her parents are escorted to prison.\\n\\nHoney inherited this condition, although it is mostly seen in her hands. When she follows in her mother’s footsteps, delivering books to those living in and around their rural area, or even in town, she feels it’s necessary for her to wear gloves to cover her hands. Most of the people she meets along the way are happy to see her riding her mother’s mule, Junia, and some remember her fondly, from when she accompanied her mother. But there are others who find her to be some kind of abomination, and make sure to let her know that she is not welcome.\\n\\nI loved the setting, the quiet charm of the Appalachian landscape alongside the quiet strength of these women resolved to fight against the ugliness of laws created out of hate, and designed to target a group of marginalized people. I love the resolve of these women, and the men who had the courage to stand by them, to believe them, and believe them, despite repercussions. I loved the strength and determination of these women, their bond as women, and, of course, this ode to books, and how the right words and stories can change the world.\\n\\n\\nPublished: 03 May 2022\\n\\nMany thanks for the ARC provided by SOURCEBOOKS Landmark',\n",
       " \"A most wonderful story!\\n\\nJust like its predecessor, The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek, The Book Woman's Daughter is a wonderful story. We are introduced to Honey Mary Angeline Lovett, the daughter of Cussy Carver, who resides in the Hills of a gorgeous Kentucky mountains, she too, is so like her mother, a blue skinned packhorse librarian. Because of their skin color, the family had been in hiding and when her parents are imprisoned because of miscegenation, (interbreeding of people of different racial backgrounds), Honey is left in the care of another woman. She is threatened with reform school because of her age and of course what she is. The blue people were different, a scourge and many felt they should not be permitted to live. Later when Honey's elderly custodian dies, Honey is bigger danger of winding up in that school that she dreads until she reaches age twenty-one.\\n\\nHoney vows to stay free and in her endeavors, she becomes what her mother once was a packhorse librarian. Honey is full of spirit and the love of family and book traveling on her cantankerous mule, she travels the hills of Kentucky through dangers and threatening people to deliver her books and bring joy to her readers. However, so many seem to be against her but she does have some in her corner. For Honey, her blue skin appears on her hands so she wears gloves hiding her hands. Through all of her trials, Honey shows her steadfast desire to remain a bookwoman and as she tries to obtain, her freedom, (emancipation) the perils seem to come faster and one wonders if she indeed will be free.\\n\\nThis is a marvelous story, told in the tradition of the first book with vivid description of the life and beauty of the Kentucky, the simplicity of life as well as its hardships. What is apparent was the people that Honey and Cussy served were delighted having books brought to them. They were thought of as treasures and a way for them to escape to another world. Both women not only delivered books but they also delivered help and hope to the people who were dirt poor.\\n\\nWomen are strong and in this story their stamina and fortitude made for a most vital book that praised the ability of people who lived in that time and place.\\n\\nThis wonderful book comes highly recommended because of its high lighting of the spirit, the resiliency, and the courage of these women who were able to bring literacy to so many.\\n\\nThank you to Kim Michele Richardson, Sourcebooks Landmark, and NetGalley for a copy of this fantastic story due out May 3, 2022.\",\n",
       " 'Awhile back the book \"The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek\" was getting rave reviews on Goodreads, so I picked it up on a kindle sale to enjoy as a private read. When I saw that a sequel was being released, I decided to finally read the original book in preparation for delving into this one. I really liked \"The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek\" which told the story of Cussy Mary, a Pack Horse Librarian who carried a special gene that made her skin look blue. For this she was sometimes feared and prejudiced; at the same time, she was also valued and much loved by her many grateful book customers.\\n\\nThis book sequel centers upon the character of Honey Lovett, who Cussy Mary raised as her own daughter after a beloved book patron passed away. Honey also carries the \"blue\" gene, although it only shows up on her hands when she gets emotional. She often wears gloves to conceal it. Honey\\'s adoptive parents have been arrested and are held in separate jails awaiting trial. It is 1953 and a crime for a white person to marry a person of color, which Cussy was considered. Honey is only sixteen, not old enough for the law to let her live on her own without a guardian. Ironically enough, the existing laws would allow her to marry, even if she were younger! It is still a society where women have less rights than men in these hills of Kentucky. The book\\'s theme swirls around Honey\\'s struggle to stay free while her adoptive parents\\' fate is sorted out. Otherwise, she could be held in an orphan\\'s home until 18 or the House of Reform where she\\'d have to toil in leg chains until the age of 21.\\n\\nHoney is self-sufficient and wise beyond her years, and would often accompany her adoptive Mom Cussy on her Pack Horse Librarian book deliveries. In Honey\\'s quest for independence she also scores a job as a traveling librarian, riding the same donkey Junia that squired Cussy to her book patrons.\\n\\nWhile there were some charming and emotionally powerful moments in the book, it lacked that special something that the original book had. I found myself skimming through certain sections that didn\\'t quite hold my interest. There seemed to be a lack of heartwarming characters and customers compared to the original book. I managed to finish the book, but wouldn\\'t seek out further sequels.\\n\\nThank you to the publisher Sourcebooks Landmark for providing an advance reader copy via NetGalley.',\n",

My favorite part of the novel is Honey developing into a strong, independent woman, and finding a kindred soul in Pearl, who is fiercely independent herself. I enjoyed their bond, which got stronger throughout the book.\\n\\nDespite Honey and Pearl facing rampant misogyny (and racism, on Honey’s part, due to her blue skin), they learn to stand up for themselves and fight back against the systemic forces trying to press them both into the ideal mold of a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed and the return to Troublesome Creek. It is always nice to have characters with such an immense love of reading and libraries at the center of a story, not to mention strong women characters supporting each other.\\n\\nMy one nitpick is that the ending, to me, was very open-ended.\\n\\n\\nI really hope there is another book in this series!

A child terrified of hard labor juvenile prison because of the production of their union. The survival of Honey Lovett is fantastic.

       " '2.5 Stars\\nThis is a sequel to The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek. Like most sequels, it is a disappointment.\\n\\nWhen the parents of sixteen-year-old Honey Lovett are imprisoned for breaking miscegenation laws, Honey’s future is in jeopardy. Wanting to avoid going to an orphans’ home or being sent to the House of Reform, she needs a guardian. When that arrangement is not an option, she decides to seek emancipation which would leave her free and independent. To show she is capable of caring for herself, she follows her mother’s footsteps and becomes an outreach librarian, a job which brings her into contact with new friends and enemies.\\n\\nreveals so much about the Blue People of Kentucky, the Kentucky Pack Horse Library Project, and life in Appalachian Kentucky. , however, offers few new historical elements; it merely recycles information already known to readers of the first book.\\n\\nThe one addition is female characters in male-dominated jobs: Pearl is a fire tower ranger and Bonnie is a coal miner. Unfortunately, these characters end up seeming like mere plot devices to emphasize the struggles of women living in a world dominated by men. The book’s message is that “’Laws about females never make a lick of sense because they’re made and run by men and meant to keep us in bondage’” so women must be courageous to stand up against injustice and inequality.\\n\\nThere were several elements that irritated me. First there’s the repetition: How many times must we be told that Junia is stubborn and doesn’t like men? How many threatening encounters must Honey have with Perry Gillis once he is clearly identified as her enemy? Then there are the plot holes: The office of Honey’s lawyer is open after 6 p.m. on a Sunday? Honey writes down “the directions for the nurse to find Retta’s home” but doesn’t leave the note and has to return later? Why would the doctor’s wife rely on Honey for books since there is a public library in town? What’s with the pre-occupation with clean clothes: Before spending a night with Doc and his wife, Honey goes home to “’pack clean clothes’” and then tells Doc that she “’packed my clean dress’” but then finds that Doc’s wife laundered and folded her clothes overnight?\\n\\nFinally, there’s the portrayal of Honey. The author wants her to be a brave heroine so she has Honey save a child. The author wants her to be intelligent so Honey, not her lawyer, first mentions emancipation. But then she is so stupid that she doesn’t tie up Junia, a mule who tends to run away? And after overhearing a conversation which clearly indicates the speakers’ intentions, she wonders “what Gillis and his kin were up to”? Honey’s father gives her a clear answer about dating, but she says, “’I haven’t received permission yet. I might need to call Papa again’’?! She will disobey Gillis and give his wife an “immoral” book, thereby endangering herself and Guyla Belle, but won’t date without permission? What is particularly annoying is that Honey, though she claims she loves books, seldom reads!\\n\\nHaving really liked , I looked forward to . However, I found little to enjoy. The narrative arc is obvious from the beginning; the protagonist behaves inconsistently though we are to admire her; and scenes have unnecessary melodramatic flourishes. The first book offers substantial historical information but, other than brief references to Moonlight Schools, Hallie Daggett and female fire lookouts, and the Frontier Nursing Service, the second book tediously repeats historical facts from the first. I think readers might enjoy more if they’ve not read .\\n\\nNote: I received a digital galley from the publisher via NetGalley.',\n",
       " 'I had read The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek when it was first published and loved the unique and enlightening story about Cussy. When I learned that Kim Michele Richardson had written a sequel to The Woman of Troublesome Creek I was excited to read it. I listened to the audio CD that was read by Katie Schorr. The Book Woman’s Daughter was a powerful and beautifully rendered story that picked up sixteen years after The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek left off. Once again, Kim Michele Richardson transported the reader back to Kentucky’s mountains of Appalachia and the people that lived there. In her newest book, The Book Woman’s Daughter, Kim Michele Richardson, explored the ignorance and racial prejudice some of the inhabitants of Troublesome Creek exhibited. The roles of the women who continued to offer their services as packhorse librarians were portrayed and honored as they tirelessly gave their patrons the power of books. Kim Michele Richardson brilliantly wrote about the strong resolve of the women of Troublesome Creek, their bravery, resilience and determination to bring about change from their male dominated lives.\\n\\nThe Book Woman’s Daughter, was the story of Honey Lovett, daughter of the blue-skinned packhorse librarian. It begins in Thousandsticks, Kentucky in 1953. After hiding from the prejudice and ignorance of the people of Troublesome Creek for most of Honey’s sixteen years, the law intervened and had taken her parents, Cussy and William, away from her and imprisoned them. It was against the law in Kentucky for a white person to marry a person of color even if the color was blue. Marrying a person of color was a violation of the miscegenation law. Since Cussy was a bluet, it had been against the law for her to marry William despite the fact that they were very much in love with each other. Honey was heartbroken to have to be separated from her loving and kind parents. Cussy and William had adopted Honey when Honey’s biological bluet mother died in childbirth. Cussy and William were the only parents Honey had known. Honey worried about her parent’s safety and how they would be treated in prison.\\n\\nHoney made her way back to Troublesome Creek as her parents had told her to do. As Honey arrived in Troublesome Creek, she was met with all kinds of challenges and dangers. Honey was able to find employment as a packhorse librarian following in her mother’s footsteps. Her route was almost identical to her mother’s route. Honey was determined to earn the right of emancipation. She was tired of hearing and listening to all the people that thought they knew what was best for her. Honey was becoming a strong woman. She could take care of herself and also do her part to help those that needed her help along the way until her parents returned. Could Honey be granted emancipation? She would do everything she could to make it happen. Could emancipation be granted to Honey even though she was a bluet?\\n\\nI really enjoyed listening to The Book Woman’s Daughter by Kim Michele Richardson. It was fast paced and brilliantly described the roles of women living in a male dominated era. The characters were vivid and well developed. Kim Michele Richardson focused on the importance of literacy throughout this book. It was disturbing for me to learn that orphaned children were sent to farms to perform hard labor until they turned twenty-one years of age. I admired the strength, courage and determination Honey possessed. I enjoyed listening to The Book Woman’s Daughter and highly recommend it.',\n",

Kayla and her young daughter proceed with moving in. The house is newly built, and backs into the woods. Kayla is instantly uneasy as she is confronted by an older, mysterious woman telling her she shouldn’t be living there. Kayla doesn’t know what the lady’s deal is.\\n\\nThen, she meets neighbor Ellie Hockley, a 65-year old who returns to her home after years of staying away. Ellie’s family refused to sell their house to the new home developers, and thus theirs is the only old house on the street. Ellie is initially welcoming, but quickly becomes a bit cold when she learns something about Kayla that brings back painful memories.\\n\\nBack in 1965, Ellie was a young woman who crusaded for Civil Rights, specifically the right for Black people to vote. What kept her away from home for 45 years? And what does have to do with it?\\n\\nTold in dual timelines, both equally enthralling, I could not put this down. Diane Chamberlain is one of my favorite authors, and she really knows how to pack an emotional punch. I felt so much while reading this: anger, frustration, heartache. As one can imagine, 1965 in a Southern state does not make for an easy read.\\n\\nMy heart broke at what some of these memorable and highly believable characters went through, and my blood boiled reading about the ignorant and hateful people who put them through it.\\n\\nAs always, Chamberlain writes with sensitivity, but doesn’t shy away from tough topics. She brilliantly ties the past to present and gives care to every character and thread. This is not an easy read, but it is important and still relevant today.\\n\\nI was crying by the end. I’m tearing up as I write this review and reflect on what I read. I will continue to tear up when I think about this book long after I have read it.\\n\\nI’ve been writing/editing this review for awhile now, and I’m having a hard time articulating what this story meant to me. Even though my review doesn’t do the book justice, just know that I highly recommend it.\\n\\nThank you to St. Martin’s Press, who kindly provided me with a widget of the ARC through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

       " \"It's been so heartening to read your wonderful reviews of The Last House on the Street! Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. I know that the ARCs don't include my Author's Notes, so I thought I would share a bit of them here:\\n\\nI was fourteen years old during the summer of 1964 when I heard the news about three young civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi. Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney and Michael Schwerner were spending the summer in the South to register Black voters. Their disappearance and tragic end may not have been the first time I’d heard about student civil rights workers, but it was the first time their work had an emotional and intellectual impact on me. The junior high school I attended in Plainfield, New Jersey was well integrated, and I was awakening to the injustices faced by people who looked like my classmates. It was impossible to grow up in Plainfield during that era and be blind to the inequities, even in the North. I was moved by the courage and passion of those young civil rights workers who were willing to face danger to do what they felt was right.\\nWhen I reached high school age, I often found myself in the library stacks lost in books and articles about racial injustice. At some point, I stumbled across information on the SCOPE program. The memory of that program stayed with me and inspired Ellie’s story in The Last House on the Street.\\nAlthough much of story related to the SCOPE program is based on truth, I took liberties with specific facts related to it. For example, while the program was publicly announced by Hosea Williams in late April, Ellie learns of it a few weeks earlier. The orientation dates, however, are accurate, as is the orientation setting of Morris Brown College in Atlanta. Hosea Williams and Andrew Young were at the orientation and Reverend Young’s conversation with the young female civil rights workers is based on reality. Martin Luther King Jr. did indeed deliver a speech at the orientation.\\nThe most dangerous work in SCOPE took place in the deep south, but I wanted to write about my adopted home state of North Carolina, where SCOPE’s work was limited to the “Black Belt” counties of Martin and Warren. However, since I was creating my own fictional world, I invented Derby County and its various towns so that I was not constrained by real events. It is true that the KKK had a very strong and growing presence in North Carolina in 1965, inspired in great part by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It’s also true that the registrars’ offices in those counties shut their doors prior to the August passage of the Voting Rights Act, which left the SCOPE students having to focus on community work other than actual registration.\\nHow wonderful it would be to be able to say that the Voting Rights Act signed by President Lyndon Baines Johnson in August 1965 put an end to voting discrimination. As President Johnson signed the bill, he stated that the right to vote was “the basic right without which all others are meaningless.” The Voting Rights Act struck down literacy tests and other regulations that blocked the right to vote and also provided federal protection to people as they registered. Most importantly, it required that states known for impeding voting rights had to “pre-clear” any changes to their voting laws with the federal government. In 2013, however, a Supreme Court decision did away with that pre-clearance requirement. As a result, as I write these notes in April 2021, legislators in at least forty-three states are considering over three hundred and fifty bills that will make voting more difficult, particularly for people of color. Several bills have already been signed into law. It’s distressing that politics continue to play such a pivotal role in what should be a basic American right.\",\n",
       " 'Diane Chamberlain is unique, fantastic storyteller, directing us to marvelous journeys at different eras : she’s the queen of historical fictions and I honestly enjoy to read her well constructed characters written with emotional depth, broadening my horizon by learning about different historical facts occurred in different states.\\n\\nThis book divided into two time zones: 1965 and 2010 and introducing us marvelous two characters: Ellie Hockley and Kayla Carter.\\n\\nTheir stories intercepted at the trophy home in Shadow Ridge Estates , located in Round Hill, North Carolina, a haunted place holding tragic memories.\\n\\nKayla and her husband Jackson are both architects, have been designing their dream house for 7 years. But now her husband lost his life while he was building the house and she has to stay strong for her four years old daughter Raine even though she misses him a lot, suffering from grief and she has second thoughts to move to new house which will mean she will start fresh by letting her husband go. Her emotional wounds are still too fresh. They are still bleeding.\\n\\nBut she stays strong and as she takes her first step to the new development along with her daughter and 65 years old father, she gets impressed by the place. It looks amazing , a beautiful place, on four wooded acres, largest lot in Shadow Ridge Estates, surrounded by woods. But some many tragic things happened in the woods that merge two time lines and stories of Kayla and Ellie.\\n\\nWhen we go back to 1965, we learn more about Ellie: the lovely neighbor of Kayla, we realize more about how those tragedies occurred, what kind of political, social circumstances created those incidents.\\n\\nEllie is twenty, enrolled to 5 years long Pharmacology program, coming home for spring break. She reunites with her best friend Brenda who is expecting and planning to marry with her love of her life Garner.\\n\\nEllie is also dating with Garner’s best friend Reed Miller for 4 years. He is handsome, trustworthy, caring 22 years old man, working at the bank, planning to be manager in near future. The four friends are inseparable. But as Ellie witnesses changes of socio-political atmosphere and its effects on their small town, she realizes she doesn’t want to live the life that’s planned for her!\\n\\nShe wants to be part of a program SCOPE for removing racism from American politics by assigning 500 volunteers at the seventy five rural counties. She’s part of conservative family and as a white girl advocating voting rights of colored people can attract the attention of several white supremacist groups including Ku Klux Klan members in NC who are targeting African Americans.\\n\\nTwo time zones are fascinatingly well constructed. Tension is palpable! The big mystery of the story hasn’t been revealed till the end. The sensitive issues including racism, interracial relationship, activism, grief are realistically and objectively approached!\\n\\nThe both story lines picked my interest and make me up all night till my eyes hurt. It was remarkable, unputdownable, powerful, sentimental, thought provoking masterpiece I highly recommend to bookworms which earned my five blazing, intense, heartfelt, family, friendship, inequality stars!\\n\\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.',\n",
       " \"Diane Chamberlain's latest haunting novel resonates so strongly with our contemporary realities where once again widescale attacks are taking place on what every citizen should be able to take for granted, the basic right to vote. In a dual line narrative, the author takes us back in time to 1965, a turbulent period of American history, to the dangerous and courageous fight for civil rights and efforts to increase voter registration within black communities in the hostile and racist American South. Architect Kayla Carter is a widow, mother to a young 3 year old daughter, Rainie, she and her husband, Jackson, designed their dream home in the beautiful Shadow Ridge Estates in North Carolina. However, Kayla is in two minds when it comes to moving in, Jackson died in an accident whilst working on their home, and the house will always hold memories of his tragic death.\\n\\nShe is left feeling uneasy and threatened when a odd older woman, who seems to have far too much knowledge about her, tells her not to move into the house, but why? Kayla then meets her neighbour, 65 year old Ellie Hockley who has come back, after a 45 year absence, due to family circumstances. At first the two women get on well until painful memories from the past are reawakened in Ellie after she learns more about Kayla. In 1965, privileged white student Ellie was home for the summer, best friend Brenda is pregnant, planning to marry Garner Cleveland and Ellie for four years has been with Reed Miller. Inspired by her late Aunt Carol, Ellie shifts her life in a completely different direction that is destined to reshape her and to have lifelong repercussions. Despite advice to the contrary, she becomes a civil rights activist and volunteer for the Summer Organisation and Political Education (SCOPE) project.\\n\\nThe dual narratives come to connect the tragic past with the present, Ellie with Kayla, in this enraging, suspenseful, and unforgettable story of race, family, love and horrifying brutality. Whilst it is a blend of fact and fiction, Chamberlain does take some liberties with history in her vibrant retelling. She immerses the reader in the riveting and timely narrative with her wonderful characterisations that bring the 1960s battle for civil rights vividly alive. Highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.\",\n",
       " \"Diane Chamberlain. She’s my gal.\\n\\nHer storytelling has the power to sweep me away, completely. When I get my hands on one of her books, I spin around in circles like Snoopy doing a happy dance. I did that with her latest, The Last House on the Street, but then a weird thing happened. I set it aside and read dozens of others ahead of it. I just NEEDED it to be so good that I was scared to read it.\\n\\nFortunately, it is good. Really good. In true Chamberlain fashion, The Last House on the Street is a dual-timeline narrative set in North Carolina. The contemporary story features a young grieving widow, Kayla, piecing together a new life for herself and her daughter, and the historical story focuses on a 20-year-old white woman, Ellie, in 1965 who goes against her family’s wishes to dedicate her time to SCOPE. The Summer Community Organization and Political Education project was a voter registration civil rights initiative conducted in six southern states. The goal was to recruit white college students to help prepare Black Americans for voting and to maintain pressure on Congress to pass what became the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\n\\nTypically dual-timeline narratives have one treasure and one turd, but I found both women’s stories equally compelling. Kayla and Ellie are likeable and easy to root for, and it was satisfying to see how their lives intertwined at the end.\\n\\nAs for the inclusion of the SCOPE project as a central plot point, I'm happy this aspect of American history has been brought to my attention. Chamberlain just scratches the surface of it by using it as a backdrop for a forbidden interracial relationship though, thus my desire to learn more about the project will send me to nonfiction resources in the future.\\n\\nSo will The Last House on the Street be recalled as one of my favorite Diane Chamberlain novels? No, she’ll be hard pressed to top Necessary Lies and The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes in my eyes. I will always recommend her books to people looking for page turners though, and this is no exception.\\n\\nI was gifted advance copies for review by St. Martin’s Press and Macmillan Audio. The audiobook features one narrator, Susan Bennett, despite the novel’s dual-timeline/-main character format. Ms. Bennett is a very capable performer though, so it was never difficult to discern any of the who/what/whens of the story. If you prefer the audio format, you won’t go wrong here.\\n\\nThe Last House on the Street is now available.\\n\\nBlog:\",\n",
       " 'Loved it!!! Could not put it down. Review to follow in a day or two.\\n\\nI’m back: .....[with basic general details -- but no spoilers -- all the best parts are left out of this review]\\n\\nThere was an instant ease I fell into while reading “The Last House on the Street”. It’s a page turner told in duel time lines. (1965 and 2010).\\nBoth storylines are emotionally powerful and intimate….and blend beautifully together.\\nThemes cover racial prejudice, interracial relationships, forbidden love, resentments, small town community, love, loss, death, activism, social justice, family, friendships, heartbreak, warmth, and humor. It’s the type of novel that keeps you reading well past midnight.\\n\\nThe dramatic tensions and mystery kept growing to the very end. Its a story that could have ended several different ways…(readers ‘will’ think about this long after the final page). I respect the ‘ending-choice’ that Diane Chamberlain made. It was a wise choice….but it was still a little fun for me to explore alternate endings.\\n\\nWhen Ellie Hockley grew up in North Carolina, a Southerner from Round Hill; Derby County, her Aunt Carol, a bold, blunt, activist, left a great impression on her.\\nAunt Carol was the only person in the family who seemed to understand Ellie. Or, as Aunt Carol told Ellie, one time, Ellie was the only person who seemed to understand ‘Aunt Carol’”.\\n\\nThe year was 1965. Ellie was twenty years of age. She was home from the University of North Carolina for spring break. Ellie was in a five year pharmacology program. She still had two years more to go.\\nEveryone was sitting in the living room. Daddy was reading the newspaper. Ellie’s older brother, Buddy,(mechanical genius), was tinkering with some small mechanical part from a car. Mama sat between Ellie and Brenda, (Ellie’s longtime best friend and dorm mate; practically a second daughter to Mama), admiring wedding dresses in a magazine.\\nBrenda, pregnant, would soon be marrying the love of her life: Garner Cleveland.\\nGarner’s best friend was Reed Miller.\\nReed Miller had been Ellie’s boyfriend for the past four years. Reed was crazy about Ellie…..(wonderful, well-respected, smart, twenty-two year old, successful, handsome man).\\nReed graduated early and was working a desk job at a bank. He was going to be the bank manager one day.\\nEllie & Reed, and Brenda & Garner spent years double dating.\\nDuring this spring break…..Ellie had a ‘moment’….she could suddenly see ‘her’ future …. and it wasn’t at all what she wanted.\\nHer Aunt Carol, once an army nurse, and a champion of civil rights, was no longer alive…but Ellie wanted to follow more in her Aunt’s ‘fight-for-justice’ footsteps. Ellie had no interest in marriage.\\n\\nUsually during summer breaks - home from college, Elli worked at the local pharmacy owned by her father. But this summer hundreds of white students from Northern and Western colleges were spending their summer in the Southern states registering Negroes to vote.\\nThe students would canvass door to door, (live with assigned families in the area), and do all they could to get folks registered to vote. The program was called SCOPE, (Summer Community Organization and Political Education project).\\nFive hundred volunteers were being sent into seventy-five rural counties with the aim of removing racism from American politics.\\nIt was exactly the type of program that Aunt Carol would’ve signed up for to help.\\nMost white families from lily white Round Hill, didn’t like the idea of crazy white kids from New York, or wherever descending on Derby County.\\nNobody in Ellie’s family was an advocate for justice. Neither was Brenda, or Garner. Reed admired Ellie’s humanity - but he didn’t want to be away from Ellie an entire summer.\\nBeing a white Southern girl, wanting to help Black folks vote was not an every day occurrence — it could also be dangerous. Ellie would need to be watchful.\\nNorth Carolina had more Ku Klux Klan members than all other states put together. White supremacist terrorist hate groups primarily targeted African-Americans. However, “The thing the Klan hates more than a Negro man is a white person who tries to ‘help’ a Negro”.\\nEllie’s, parents, Buddy, Brenda, Reed, ….even Reverend Greg Filbern, from Darville, pastor of a Negro Church,(AME church in Turner’s Bend), in Derby County, on other side of town from Round Hill, tried to discourage Ellie in joining SCOPE.\\nEllie joins anyway - determined to make a difference….to be on the right side of human rights.\\n\\n\\nIn the year 2010….\\nKayla Carter, an architect, had been designing a dream home for seven years — along with her husband Jackson, who was also an architect.\\nJackson died from an accident while building their new home.\\nKayla had many reservations about moving forward- moving into the house without her husband. She was still grieving. But she had a three year old daughter: Rainie, to think about….and her father, who lived near by. Kayla and Rainie would move into that large home. Kayla would have her sixty-five year old fit and healthy father nearby. And Rainie would grow up with a Grandfather in her life\\n\\nThe house was spectacular. Large. A contemporary home on four wooded acres.\\nIt had floor to ceiling windows and was considered the best and largest of the lot in the new development (in Shadow Ridge Estates), surrounded by gorgeous thick greenery of trees.\\nThose woods were filled with Kudzu back in 1965. Children played in those woods. They thought they heard strange noises coming from the Kudzu plants. Those vines are treehuggers—bad for the ecosystems…\\nit was easy to imagine how kids thought the area was haunted.\\nMemories don’t die easily ….and even people still living in the area in 2010, thought the area might be haunted. Some tragic history lived in those woods….history that Kayla was unfamiliar with.\\n\\nThese two stories emerge…..\\nWe meet a wonderful extended cast of characters in both time periods.\\nDiverse students - interesting families - in 1965 - horrific prejudice -\\nand some very emotional heartache.\\n\\nWe meet interesting neighbors - puzzling neighbors - Kayla was bumping up against mystery and history that she had no prior knowledge of in 2010. Secrets, rather withheld information, doesn’t rise to the surface easily….but when it does….it’s quite emotional.\\n\\nWonderful novel. I’ve come to admire and love Diane Chamberlain more and more each time I read her books. I could be friends with this woman. She’s wonderful. She is a best-selling author, having published thirty novels in more than twenty languages.\\nI say that’s a woman to admire.\\nDiane Chamberlain is a great gift to many readers for many years!!\\nFunny, I think the last time I read one of her books… I was going to be a retired reviewer. I failed - I’m still hanging around.\\n\\nThank you Netgalley, St. Martin’s Press (a wonderful publishing company with a staff with hearts bigger than the whole wide world),\\nand a special thanks to Diane Chamberlain.',\n",

She joins the SCOPE project despite the protest of her loved ones, and it changes her life forever. In 2010, Kayla is recently widowed and needing to move into her new house. But her husband died in that house, and now that she’s receiving threats she’s not so sure it was the dream she has expected.\\n\\nThis is the first Diane Chamberlain novel I’ve read but it definitely won’t be my last. I was absolutely riveted by this novel. I didn’t want to have to put it down. It touches on some very difficult and dark subjects in regards to Racism, which some may find difficult to read. It was haunting and chilling but so incredibly important too. I found it really interesting learning about the SCOPE project. But I was also horrified at how this is humanities recent past, and even present in many ways.\\n\\nI completely fell in love with the character of Ellie. Her pure strength, bravery and kindness is something I have never seen in a novel. I think the reflection of people like Ellie and the other SCOPE volunteers in real life, is what made her so incredible to me. It was a reminder that there are people in this world who are willing to fight for what’s right, no matter the personal consequences. Unfortunately, I didn’t connect in quite the same way with Kayla. I just found her character difficult to sympathize with it times. I think I could have liked her more if she wasn’t having to compete with Ellie in mind. This novel compelled me to keep reading, pulled on all of my heartstrings, taught me so much and touches on some incredibly important lessons!\\n\\nI recommend this to everyone, but please be cautious if some of the topics in this book may be difficult for you.

       " \"3.5*\\n\\nDiane Chamberlain is one of my favourite authors. I'm always excited when she has a new book out. I've read many of her books and she is a powerful writer.\\n\\nIn saying that I was a little disappointed with the start of the book (well the first chapter starts off rather intriguing...but then I found it to run pretty slow right up until the 50% mark.) The first half of the book was a definite 3 stars for me. The second half took off and I'm grading that part a full 4 stars. Hence my rating for the full story averages out to a 3.5 stars.\\n\\nIt's a dual timeline that alternates between 1965 and Ellie's story and 2010 and Kayla's story. The 1965 story was the highlight for me. It involved the civil rights movement, bigotry and the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina. It was a very emotional story that enraged and saddened me. Kayla's story tied in nicely at the end but I was not as invested in it.\\n\\nFor the most part I enjoyed it although IMHO this is not Diane Chamberlain at her best. With an extraordinary catalogue like hers it's understanding that she will have the occasional mediocre one.

As she learns to duck when a truck goes by, to hide in the shadows, and gets a firsthand look at the ugliness of hate groups such as the KKK...and for the first time, she is forced to reevaluate her life, what she has, and what she's willing to risk to follow her heart's desires.. Will her summer with SCOPE change her life forever? Can she protect those she loves, or can a force stronger than sheer will tear her whole world to pieces?\\n\\nChamberlain has chosen an interesting time to explore the issues present in this book, as voting rights have been thrust into the national spotlight yet again with our most recent presidential election. The fact that we are still lamenting a broken system while so many of us feel powerless to change it speaks to just how devastating it is to so many Americans. My only frustration with Chamberlain in this novel is that the SCOPE group (which I had never heard of until reading this book, sadly!) fell into a bit of the 'white savior' narrative and felt at times a bit stereotypical. Ellie is praised again and again for how 'good' and virtuous she is by different characters, and it felt a little inauthentic at times. I know standing for these causes at the time (especially in the deep South) was a statement in and of itself, but the adulations did feel a bit redundant to me after a while.\\n\\nI also think there is something problematic with presenting racism (in today's more informed world) as solely 'belonging' to outright hate groups like the KKK. A deepening conversation across the country points to the INSTITUTION of racism, which is a systemic problem, rather than simple bigotry, and unfortunately is upheld in so many different areas, from gentrification of cities to gerrymandering...which again, hinders voting rights. In this respect, I applaud Chamberlain for focusing on voting rights in the narrative, I just wish there was more of a balanced perspective from of the characters.\\n\\nAll of that being said, there is a lot of heart and food for thought in this narrative and a bit of mystery to keep you guessing until the end. The tragic ending might be a bit predictable in some regards, but the resolution felt fitting. Fans of Picoult (and obviously Chamberlain) will enjoy the balance in this one between what has been and what can be, and I appreciate Chamberlain's willingness to explore this time period and hopefully someday, her 2010 timeline will feel as 'in the past' as the initial civil rights push of the 60's...but until then, as Ellie and her compatriots sang:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4 stars\",\n",
       " '2.5 stars.\\n\\nTold in two timelines, this historical mystery focuses on the 1960’s voters registration civil rights initiative in the southern states. The Summer Community Organization And Political Education (SCOPE) Project was a movement where young White men and women canvassed door to door in rural Black counties encouraging the citizens to register to vote. Though voting was legal for all citizens, law makers and enforcers in these southern states did everything they could to make it difficult and often impossible for Blacks to vote.\\n\\nAn informative look at this important time in our history. I recognize and appreciate all the research that would have went into creating this story. Learning about SCOPE was fascinating. The dedication of these members was inspiring and hopeful, especially coming from such a dark and difficult time where it was a constant challenge and often dangerous to move forward and try to make change.\\n\\nThe author does an excellent job educating her readers on this important civil rights movement, however, I had no connection to the characters. I appreciate this for being an educational read only. The mystery, the storyline, the characters — none of it worked for me which is very unusual for this author. While the plot involved very important subject matter, it was not conveyed in a convincing manner. I had zero connection to the main character in either timeline which prevented me from feeling any sort of investment.\\n\\nThe Past timeline ending is intense, but I wasn’t emotionally involved so it lacked the powerful punch it should have had. The Present Day storyline was dull and predictable.\\n\\nOverall, this was and informative and educational read, but not an entertaining or enjoyable one. I am a big fan of this author and would rank this book my least favourite of hers. I encourage you to pick up any of this authors other work before this one, however, I am the outlier in my opinion as many have loved it.\\n\\nThank you St Martin’s Press for the digital review copy!',\n",
       " \"This a hard hitting Historical Fiction. This book is told by two timelines (1965 in Ellie's point of View and 2010 in Kayla's Point of View). This book shows how hard blacks and some whites how to fight for Civil Rights for the Blacks in the South. I grow up in the North Carolina where Southern views where, and I also felt like Ellie did lucky I was not alive during 1965. It was a hard time in our history, and I hope no one forgets it. This book is one of those books I will not forget it for a long time. The ending had a twist, but I had already figured out the twist, but I do not think that took away from me enjoying this book. I do feel that some of the 2010 parts did not need to be there. I listen to the audiobook from this book, and I think the narrator did a great job. I really enjoyed this audiobook. I was kindly provided an e-audiobook of this book by the publisher or author (Diana Chamberlain) via NetGalley, so I can give an honest review about how I feel about this book. I want to send a big Thank you to them for that.\",\n",
       " 'Culpability\\nThe Last House on the Street is an engaging, thoughtful and reflective murder mystery that the past cries out to be solved.\\n\\nAs two architects, Kayla Carter and her husband, Jackson, designed and built their dream home in the exclusive Shadow Ridge Estates in Round Hill, North Carolina. Backing onto woods, as the last house on the street, they had the prime location in the new housing estate and within walking distance of the Hockley’s home that stood for a very long time. Just before the house move, Jackson died in an accident at their new home, leaving Kayla unsure whether she now wanted to move or not. She is torn between the house bringing up terrible memories of Jackson’s death and memories of how passionate they were as they designed the house for each other and their daughter Rainie. Before Kayla moves, a strange woman warns her off moving into the house. Warnings aside, Kayla and Rainie move in and things start happening, leaving Kayla wondering if someone is playing tricks on them or do ghosts from the past have an issue with her house being close to woods that harbour secrets. These issues Kayla discusses with her father, who lives close by, and Ellie Hockley, who has returned to Round Hill for the first time since she left forty-five years ago.\\n\\nIn 1965 a young twenty-year-old Ellie Hockley felt compelled to join the SCOPE project to encourage black voters to register to vote when President Lyndon B Johnson would sign the Voting Rights Act. The SCOPE project was an incredibly ambitious scheme to recruit white college students (typically from Northern states) to live with Southern black families and encourage them to prepare to vote. As one of the only Southern students enrolled in the programme, Ellie faces incredible pressure from her family and friends and breaks off her relationship with long-term boyfriend Reed Miller. The hidden discrimination, even within families, is strikingly drawn in this novel. The incitement to the conflict that typically followed crowd gatherings, like the KKK (or Maga crowd), is startling how it can draw seemingly ordinary people into unconscionable actions.\\n\\nContemplating the two timelines illustrated in the novel, we cannot help but consider how much things have changed from 1965 to 2010 and how much they have remained the same. The step forward to racial equality in the US is a torturous one, and reflecting the 1960s onto today’s world shows the open disparity in the treatment of blacks and whites. A story with voter suppression as its central theme and the brutality handed out to prevent blacks voting may not be as brutal today, but it certainly has the same objective, albeit more covertly. Recently there have been excellent books, like “Sing, Unburied Sing”, “The Prophets”, and “The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois” from black writers who convey a perspective and a deep pain that cannot be tapped into by white authors. However, I appreciate how Diane Chamberlain provides the view of white people who have taken up the cause for equality, regardless of race, colour or creed.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoy reading a book that, on its face, is a fascinating story with drama, suspense and mystery, but layered on top of historical events that educate and inform. Diane Chamberlain is building a reputation as an author that can uniquely deliver this with the right balance between storytelling and fact. The more intriguing timeline is 1965 with the dangerous situation Ellie encounters; although there are moments, I had difficulty accepting the choices made. The 2010 timeline with Kayla seems to be of secondary concern and mainly used to tie up several mysteries from the past without a strong theme of its own.\\n\\nI enjoy Diane Chamberlain’s writing and her desire to share her perspective on racial discrimination in the US. I would recommend reading this book, and I want to thank St Martin’s Press and NetGalley for providing a free ARC in return for an honest review.',\n",

       " \"HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY!\\n\\nAnother deeply moving and meaningful book from Diane Chamberlain.\\n\\nThis is a dual timeline novel. It alternates between Kayla in 2010, a young widow who has just moved into a house with her four-year-old daughter that she and her late husband had designed. While at work one day, a woman comes into her office and knows far too much information about Kayla and her property and warns Kayla away from living there among other dire proclamations. The second timeline is 1965, where Ellie is a college student. She learns about the SCOPE project (Summer Community Organization and Political Education) whose main purpose is to help Black people register to vote. Ellie is passionate about joining the cause, much to the dismay of her parents and her close friends. Despite their ardent disapproval, Ellie becomes firmly committed to the mission of the group and becomes close friends with Win, a young Black man she is assigned to canvass with. In 2010, Kayla becomes acquainted with Ellie, who has just returned to town to care for her ailing mother and brother. The two timelines will intersect in ways no one can imagine.\\n\\nI became completely captivated by the narrative from the beginning. I was incredibly curious as to the identity of this mystery woman trying to warn Kayla away and what her motive might be. I was caught up in learning about the tremendous obstacles in place to keep Black citizens from registering to vote. Even the white college students' lives were in danger for helping the cause. The fact that this occurred within the lifetime of many people alive today is astounding to me, and it makes this fictional account all the more important for the education of readers about bigotry and deeply held prejudice.\\n\\nI was in tears by the end, as the 1965 timeline drew to a close. The 2010 storyline was definitely the weaker of the two, as Kayla is not as developed and well-drawn as Ellie. I never really felt her fear or her loss like I did that of Ellie.\\n\\nI both listened to the audiobook narrated by Susan Bennett and read a print copy. Bennett does an amazing job with her narration. I love alternating between the two formats because it means I can always be reading regardless of what I'm doing at the moment.\\n\\nRegardless, this is a wonderfully written book. Fans of Diane Chamberlain and those who have never read her books before should definitely pick it up when released in January 2022.\\n\\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\",\n",

Some from the little lies we tell ourselves to make us feel like we're standing on more solid surfaces. Some lies erupt after being marinated over decades and passed on from generation to generation. These are the ones that sink beneath the surface and decay holier ground.\\n\\nDiane Chamberlain presents a split storyline that pivots from 1965 and lands on happenings in 2010. It settles itself near Greenville, North Carolina with a base located in the small community of Round Hill. Believe me. Prepare yourself to be tussled in both directions.\\n\\nIn more present days, Kayla Carter is a successful architect who is bogged under the weight of moving into her dream house in Round Hill. She and her husband, Jackson, designed and carried out the plans to the nth degree on this jaw-dropping property. But Jackson won't be guiding the moving van in front of this luxurious piece of real estate. Jackson died in a freak accident on the top floor. Kayla is torn as to the rationale for still residing in that house with its sad memory. But she justifies it with the hard work put into it by Jackson himself. She and her three year old daughter, Rainie, eventually move in with the support of her father, Reed.\\n\\nChamberlain adds a thread of mystery when a red-haired woman with reflective sunglasses visits Kayla at her office. Ann Smith seems to threaten Kayla if she intends on residing in that house. But within moments, this strange woman flits out of the office leaving Kayla with more questions than answers.\\n\\nWe now take a step back in time to 1965 during the Civil Rights Movement. We have the honorable Freedom Riders and those who worked diligently to secure the voting rights of the Black community in the deep South. There were an array of individuals who came from the North with a multitude of intentions varying from strong intent to mild curiosity. Some made successful inroads while others merely disrupted and endangered the lives of these families who opened their homes to them. It's still a heavy moment of deep reflection.\\n\\nAnd here is where we are introduced to Ellie Hockley, a student attending the University of North Carolina. Ellie has a strong desire to become part of the SCOPE Project working in the Black community. But Ellie's naivete will draw the walls in closer and eventually bring the house down. Ellie will become the bridge between these two time periods in this novel.\\n\\nThe Last House On the Street had a remarkable opportunity to stick solo with the 1965 storyline. The 2010 thread added present day tension and mystery and served as a connecting point. Although a fictional work, this novel had a thunderous avenue to gear readers into the lead up to the Voting Rights Act that LBJ insisted on treading water for far too long. Through the characters of Ellie and Win and the community at large, we would have had a vehicle of more profound understanding. But it's still a top-shelf, eye-opening read.\\n\\nI received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review.

       " 'This is the fifth book by Diane Chamberlain that I’ve read. Her MO is to write historical fictions that take place in North Carolina.\\nIn 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act and the SCOPE project took place over the summer to register blacks in six southern states. This book, told in a dual timeline, covers the project in North Carolina. Elly is a 20 year old white woman, a sophomore in college, when she decides to sign up as a volunteer.\\nThe second timeline of the story takes place in 2010. Kayla is a young, recently widowed architect when a strange woman comes to her office and knows more about her than she should. And tells her not to move into her newly completed house.\\nAs is so often the case with dual storylines, the historical one is much more interesting than the latter. It details the breadth of the bigotry of the day, the prevalence and hatred of the KKK. I’ll never think of the hymn The Old Rugged Cross the same way again.\\nI was engrossed by Ellie and her story, but Kayla seemed more like a plot device than a real person. It didn’t take long to determine how the story would play out. It’s that obvious. But I did enjoy learning about the SCOPE project. This was probably my least favorite of Chamberlain’s books just because it was so obvious. I would have also liked for her to have woven a little more historic facts into the story, but that’s a personal preference of mine.\\nMy thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.',\n",

With The Last House on the Street, she has crafted another intriguing family drama laced with mystery and set in an important historical era. This fast-paced read held my interest all the way, and I read it in record time (for me).\\n\\nThe story is primarily set in North Carolina in dual timelines. Our protagonists are Ellie during 1965 and her boyfriend Reed’s daughter Kayla in 2010. Both women are highly likable and well-developed, and I connected easily with both. Ellie has a keen interest in civil rights. In 1965, as a 20-year-old, she joins a group whose mission is to canvass Black neighborhoods encouraging the people to register to vote. In 2010 Kayla has just moved into her self-designed dream house with her young daughter after the untimely death of her young husband. The house is the last house on the street that Ellie grew up on. There is something unsettling about Kayla’s new home and the woods it abuts. They seem to be haunted. I was equally interested in both threads throughout most of the novel though the 1965 tale grabbed me more towards the end. Of interest, many of the same characters take part in both timelines.\\n\\nSeveral mysterious happenings are weaved together to make this a compelling read. Ms. Chamberlain even throws in yet another mystery at 91%. I was unable to guess the outcome of anything until everything was revealed in the closing chapters. The story is full of family strife, suspense, and traumatic events. Themes include rascism, hatred, tragedy, betrayal, friendship, love, healing, and hope.\\n\\nI must admit my knowledge base has a big gap when it comes to the civil rights struggles back in the 1960s. Ms. Chamberlain clearly did her research as she wrote the 1965 timeline showing us up close what those civil rights efforts were like. Things were very harrowing for the volunteers as well as for the southern Black population. I soaked up the knowledge like a sponge and learned a lot. This is a trademark of the Chamberlain books I have read. She always has as background an intriguing well-researched historical aspect that I never fail to learn from.\\n\\nThis book has a lot of heart and a hopeful ending. I highly recommend it to everyone.\\n\\nI want to thank Net Galley, Ms. Erica Martirano of St. Martins Press, and Ms. Diane Chamberlain for an advanced copy of the book.

I have read several of her previous books with much pleasure. This enthralling story is told in dual timelines and immerses the reader in modern times and takes one back in history to 1965 to the turmoil and strife of the Civil Rights movement. Central to this well-written, atmospheric novel is how some people strive to move on in life after profound loss and tragedy, and how others may retain long-held hatred, secrets, and vengeance.\\n\\nIn 1965, Ellie is attending University with her best friend, Brenda. Brenda has a quiet wedding to the love of her life as she is pregnant, and wants to finish her year. Ellie is studying to be a pharmacist like her father, who has given the family a comfortable lifestyle in a small town in North Carolina. Ellie's boyfriend, Reed, has a promising career in banking, is handsome and popular, and considered a great marriage prospect. Ellie decides marriage to Reed and working in a pharmacy is not in her immediate future and joins the Civil Rights movement to advise black communities on registering to vote and the advantages this will entail. Her parents and brother react strongly against her decision. She loses Brenda's friendship. She travels through poor, black southern communities, facing hardship but exhilaration that she is doing important work. She makes new friends, falls in love, and experiences shocking prejudice. It ends very badly for her and she leaves the state.\\n\\nMoving forward by forty-five years, we meet Kayla, a young architect. She and her architect husband designed an ultra-modern dream house that is almost ready to move in. However, her husband died in a tragic fall while inspecting the unfinished house, and Kayla is now a widow with a young daughter. She now regards the beautiful home as ominous and sinister, but it is a monument to her late husband. It sits surrounded by trees on the edge of a dark, eerie forest at the end of a gloomy street. At present, there is only one older house, but a new, contemporary housing development is being constructed. Now, she feels some apprehension about moving in with her small daughter. While working at her office, an odd woman visits, frightening her. The stranger knows the details of Kayla's life and warns her not to move into the new home. The madwoman tells her that she has an obsession to commit murder. Soon some grisly acts of vandalism occur at the still-empty home. Her kindly father dotes on his granddaughter and he cares for her while Kayla is at her work. He has some reservations about her living there. Many townspeople feel the woods are evil and haunted and she fears may be perilous to her young child.\\n\\nWhile visiting a woman at the nearest house and being welcomed as a new friend, she encounters an acquaintance of that woman. This woman addresses Kayla sharply, demanding she tear down the treehouse in the wooded area and abandon plans to have a fence installed. She learns her new friend has moved in temporarily to care for her aging mother and fatally ill brother.\\n\\nThis gripping story involves romance, tragic deaths, prejudice, intrigue, and a decades-old mystery with its shocking conclusion.

The focus of the story in 1965 is the Civil Rights Movement, just prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. It’s told through the point of view of a young white woman, Ellie Hockley, who volunteers for the SCOPES Project working to get Black Americans registered to vote.

I knew that even though half of this dual time line story takes place in 1965, it would be relevant today. It’s a shame, really, how relevant. It’s chilling that white supremacy is so alive and well. A racially motivated mass shooing happened yesterday in Buffalo, NY. Recently, a number of states have passed laws making it more difficult for some people to vote, in many areas targeting the black population. And there was Charlottesville in 2017.

It’s a house that already has devastating tragedy associated with it as her husband Jackson suffers a fatal fall whilst working there. When malicious and threatening ‘Ann Smith’ visits her she makes Kayla feel even more fearful of moving in than she already is as it seems there is resentment of the building of properties on that particular part of Round Hill.\\n\\nIn 1965 twenty year old Ellie Hockley ,also from Round Hill, takes the decision to join the SCOPE project (Summer Community Organization and Political Education) where white volunteers live with black families and visit others in the vicinity to encourage them to register to vote once LBJ signs the Voting Rights Bill. Two storylines- how do they connect?\\n\\nFirst of all, I’ve read quite a lot about the civil rights movement but didn’t know about Scope so I’m really glad to have learned something ‘new’. The novel starts well and I think the 1965 storyline is very good although apart from Scope it doesn’t tell you anything you don’t already know about the situation in the 1960’s. However, this part of the story is written extremely well and it’s very compelling and absorbing. Ellie is very likeable, her motives are good, she’s brave and she has to be as she faces tremendous opposition from family and friends. Her mother, Miss Pat, is something else although several characters hold views that are utterly appalling. As the storyline progresses we learn more about her reasons for volunteering as she confesses all to Win, a fellow volunteer who is one of the stand out characters of the book. These sections are full of danger, it’s creepy, chilling, tense, full of sickening bigotry and physical threats. The narrative takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and makes you feel a whole range of feelings from shock to anger, to wanting to weep with frustration and sheer sadness. Ellie’s story for me is what carries the book and keeps me reading on.\\n\\nHowever, I don’t feel the same about Kayla’s story I’m sorry to say. I don’t feel the creep, it doesn’t jump out at the pages and speak to me. Saying something is creepy is not the same as making a reader feel it. I’m not at all convinced by the scare tactics of 2010 as they feel contrived and directed at the wrong person in particular the actions of the Ann Smith character don’t feel plausible. Some of what happens in this timeline becomes predictable, there isn’t much surprise when all the dots are joined and then it’s all sown up too neatly after all that build up. To be honest, I’d have preferred the book without Kayla's story as the same thing could have been achieved by focusing on Ellie in the same date.\\n\\nOverall, though because the 1965 storyline is a very powerful one that carries the day and is the reason for my four star rating.\\n\\nWith thanks to NetGalley and Headline/Headline Review for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\",\n",

       " '3.5 stars: Author Diane Chamberlain was fourteen years-old in the summer of 1964 when three civil rights workers were brutally murdered in Mississippi. The event sparked an interest about racial injustices and led her to information on the SCOPE program (Summer Community Organization and Political Education). President Lyndon Johnson was gearing up to sign the 1965 Voting Rights Act which would allow blacks to vote, without needing to take a literacy exam.\\n\\nChamberlain sets “The Last House on the Street” in dual timelines; in 1965 Ellie Hockley is home on spring break from University of North Carolina when she learns that university students from the north are spending their summer in the south to educate blacks on the importance of voting. Ellie is from an affluent family, one that expects their daughter to marry and become a wife and mother. The 1965 timeline encompasses Ellie’s summer when she defied her parents and did volunteer work for the SCOPE program.\\n\\nThe other timeline is 2010 where Kayla Carter is moving into a new home, designed by her and her architect husband. Her husband died in an accident working on the house; Kayla is moving in with her three-year-old daughter. Kayla’s father lives in town and helps Kayla as she struggles to create a new life in her dream home.\\n\\nThe women are tied together because they live on the same street. Prior to Kayla’s home being built, it was just the Hockley home on the street. Now, a new subdivision is going in, and Kayla’s is the first house. Strange things happen to Kayla before she moves in. A suspicious woman with red hair and reflecting sunglasses warns Kayla NOT to move in. There are rumors that the woods abutting her property are haunted and known to be a KKK meeting place.\\n\\nThe best parts of the novel are Ellie’s chapters. Chamberlain researched what that summer was like for those students who were placed in the deep south, attempting to educate the black community. As I read, I had forgotten how afraid the black community was of white people. They didn’t want to vote for fear of losing whatever menial job they had. They were fearful of retribution. The fear that the students endured is frightening. The dropout rate was high.\\n\\nKayla’s chapters build suspense. Kayla tries to unravel what is the basis of the rumors surrounding her property. It appears that there is someone(s) who doesn’t want her to use her property.\\n\\nAs in Chamberlain fashion, she builds suspense as the story unfolds. The last third of the novel is a busy page-turning activity. The historical-fiction portion about the SCOPE program is superb.',\n",

       " \"In a Nutshell: First half pretty good, second half is a cheesy, corny mash. Offers a decent look at Shanghai during WWII, but the romantic relationship overshadows the war story.\\n\\nStory Synopsis:\\n1940, Shanghai. Twenty-year-old Aiyi is the owner of a successful night club. Rich and beautiful, she appears to have firm control over her life, but she knows her future path. She is engaged to another rich Chinese, and she knows she'll be expected to give up her business and settle into the life of a glam wife. When a young German Jewish refugee named Ernest Reismann joins her club as a pianist, her life changes, her dreams change. But can she change her future, risking it for an impoverished refugee who'll never be accepted by her people? Add to this the increasingly unstable local environment, thanks to the Japanese occupation. How will life turn out for Aiyi and Ernest?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n😍 While still a WWII story, the plot offers a perspective not usually seen in this genre: that of the Japanese-occupied Chinese and the refugee Shanghai Jews. It was enlightening to learn about this aspect of WWII.\\n\\n😍 Often, stories of struggle are written from the point of view of middle class or impoverished characters. Aiyi being rich gives us an angle not often seen in historical fiction: that of a wealthy young heiress who does her best to be independent despite the constraints of her time and location, and at the same time, being proud of her financial status and beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\n😐 There are quite a few metaphorical bits that seem to take inspiration from Chinese sayings. These were thought-provoking. But as the rest of the book was straightforward in its writing, these felt forced in.\\n\\n�� Aiyi isn't a likeable character. While she should have been inspirational by virtue of being a successful business owner in a patriarchal world, she is shown as selfish, judgemental, and short-sighted. She doesn't shy away from flaunting the rewards of her wealth, and looks down on those who are careless about their appearance. This adds a nice challenge to the story: how to be patient with a character who gets on your nerves. The book can be called a coming-of-age story, with Aiyi's character as the lynchpin.\\n\\n😐 While the plot reveals a lot about Shanghai history and culture, it also contains a lot of stereotypes about China. The only person to see Shanghai in a positive light was Ernest. From Aiyi, all we get is cliches.\\n\\n\\n\\n😒 The story has too many indecisive characters who are made to abruptly change their minds in order to alter the direction of the story. It felt like a lazy way of adding twists to the plot. Characters go randomly from good to bad to good to bad, relationships switch randomly been on and off and on and off,…\\n\\n😒 I'd have loved less focus on the romantic angle and more on the social angle. The romance was too instant to be believable.\\n\\n😒 There's too much of telling in the writing and yet, many important details aren't told. Time jumps happen like nobody's business.\\n\\n😒 There's a secret in the book. You can guess the big reveal at least 30-40 chapters before it happens. (The book has 92 chapters!)\\n\\n😒 There's only one Japanese guy who keeps harassing them almost throughout the book. Seriously, only one. Every time. No matter what the scene or location.\\n\\n😒 One of the chapters contains a few paragraphs in excruciating detail about Japanese torture of prisoners; this is very gruesome to read. What bugs me is that this sequence has absolutely no bearing on the main plot. It's just that one character goes to that location, we get a few paragraphs of horrifying information, and the character is out. What was the point of that segment? Just to create some kind of impact of the brutality? It felt so out of place!\\n\\n😒 There are many more grouses I have but all of those would require leaking of spoilers. So just know, quite a lot of silly things happen in the second half, events that make no sense at all! Too many ad hoc alterations and exaggerations. The second half messed up all the good feelings created in the first 50%.\\n\\nBasically, while I did enjoy some aspects of the book, the second half came straight out of a bad television soap. (Ekta Kapoor's shows, my Indian friends.) The writing is too convenient, the characters are mostly hackneyed, and the only redeeming factor about the romance is the unusual Jewish-Chinese combo.\\n\\nA skippable book. Read if you must, move on if you can. (Also note, this is an outlier review. So feel free to ignore all I said and give this a go. A majority of readers loved this book.)\\n\\n2.8 stars. (4 stars for the first quarter, 3.5 for the second quarter, 2 stars for the rest. Hence averaged to 2.8 stars.)\\n\\n\\nMy thanks to The Last Rose of Shanghai and NetGalley for the DRC of “Lake Union Publishing”.

       " 'This book is my favorite kind of historical fiction – an engrossing story that also opens my eyes to a piece of history I wasn’t familiar with. The story is set in Shanghai under Japanese occupation during WWII and is told from the alternating points of view of Aiyi and Ernest. Aiyi is a young Chinese heiress with a love for jazz who owns one of Shanghai’s most popular nightclubs (she is quite the entrepreneur for her day!). Ernest is a penniless Jewish refugee from Germany searching for shelter in Shanghai. The two are brought together through music, and a great story of love, survival, and redemption unfolds.\\n\\nThe book is beautifully written. I wasn’t aware that Shanghai was a safe harbor for European Jews early in the war. About 20,000 Jews settled in Shanghai from 1938 to 1941, but the living conditions for the Jewish refugees in Shanghai deteriorated over the course of the war due to pressure on the Japanese from their German allies. The descriptions of life in Shanghai, including the luxury living of jazz clubs and fancy hotels as well as the settlements and ghettos, were captivating and allowed me to visualize the time and place. The book is also well-researched, and the author does a great job of exploring the relationships and distrust among the Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners who are all co-existing and trying to survive in the war-torn city. I did think the love story between Aiyi and Ernest got quite dramatic at times (blindly running into battle zones more than once to find each other!), but I found them to be really enjoyable characters and I cared for them from beginning to end.\\n\\nI’ve read a number of WWII books focused on Europe or Japan, but I wasn’t aware of the events in Shanghai. I’m really glad I came across this book, and the author has piqued my interest about this piece of history. She included a list of further reading at the end of the book to learn more about Shanghai during WWII, and I will definitely be adding some of them to my TBR list!\\n\\nAmazon First Reads - November 2021',\n",

It felt very long and I started to skim about half way through.\\n\\nMany details were glossed over. It felt like the events were being listed off and they weren’t descriptive enough for me. I was being told, not shown what was happening. For example: After Ernest was hired, time skipped forward by several months and the club was flourishing. It didn’t go through the details of Ernest assimilating to life in Shanghai or the developing romance, they just kind of happened.\\n\\nThis was almost like an insta-love romance. It would jump forward in time and their relationship developed very fast and mainly due to physical attraction. I wish it was explored more.',\n",
       " 'Amazon first reads failed me again. This book is written in the style of \"this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened.\" It literally reads like just a list of events, descriptors are uncreative and repetitive, and it is certainly NOT the \"timeless and sweeping story\" that the description would suggest.

       " 'I listened to the audio CD of The Last Rose of Shanghai by Weina Dai Randel and learned so much about Shanghai’s history during World War II. The audio CD was pleasantly performed by Josh Bloomberg and Emily Woo Zeller. Most of the books that I had previously read about World War II and the Holocaust took place primarily in Nazi occupied countries in Europe. Little had been written about Shanghai’s fate during World War II. The Last Rose of Shanghai captured the little known history of the more than twenty thousand Jewish refugees that escaped the throes of the Nazis and found safety in Shanghai. It also focused on the effects Japanese-occupied Shanghai had on the Chinese inhabitants, foreigners that had made Shanghai their home and on the Jewish refugees. The Last Rose of Shanghai was well written and impeccably well researched. Weina Dai Randel proved that she was a gifted storyteller with this book. The Last Rose of Shanghai was engrossing, rich in details about the time period and an unforgettable love story. The chapters alternated between the POV’S of Aiyi and Ernest during the war and occupation and then by Aiyi in present time.\\n\\nIn 1940, Aiyi Shao was an accomplished, successful and beautiful young business woman and heiress. Aiyi owned a night club in Shanghai. She had lived in Shanghai her whole life as did her family. Up until the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, her club had been quite profitable. The Japanese were making it very difficult for Chinese born business owners to get the things they needed to run their businesses. They had also imposed taxes and in general were making life difficult for the Chinese people of Shanghai. Aiyi was no exception to these exploitations. She was having a hard time getting liquor for her club. Her business was definitely suffering. Following Chinese customs, Aiyi was promised to marry her childhood playmate, Chun. They recently had become engaged but Aiyi was not sure how she felt about Chun and she was in no hurry to get married.\\n\\nErnest Reismann arrived in Shanghai at about this time from Germany. His parents had remained in Germany awaiting their papers to allow them to follow Ernest and his younger sister Miriam to Shanghai. Ernest was lucky to have escaped Germany and the Nazis. Shanghai was one of the only ports that allowed Jews entry even without a passport. When Ernest arrived in Shanghai he was penniless but hopeful. He was given a room to live in for both himself and his sister. It was sparse of furniture and bug infested but Ernest was hopeful that he would be able to get a better place for him and his sister after he found work. Jobs were hard to come by, though, especially for refugees. No one would hire him no matter what the job.\\n\\nAiyi and Ernest met by chance. She was immediately drawn to his beautiful and expressive blue eyes. It was frowned upon for Chinese to socialize with refugees. Ernest found himself in the same club Aiyi was in one night. He somehow found himself playing the piano. Ernest and Aiyi were attracted to each other immediately. Aiyi ended up hiring Ernest to play the piano at her club. He was a talented pianist and he helped restore the popularity and success of her club with his playing. Ernest often played Aiyi’s favorite jazz song, The Last Rose of Shanghai, for her. The two fell in love and began an impossible doomed affair. Aiyi and Ernest had to keep their love a secret. After all, Aiyi was engaged to be married and their affair could ruin her family’s reputation. Through heartbreak, tragedies, danger and prejudice Aiyi and Ernest never lost sight of the love they felt for each other, though.\\n\\nThe Japanese invasion of Shanghai was not a part of history I was familiar with. They placed foreigners that had not fled Shanghai when the Japanese invaded in internment camps during the occupation. Conditions in those camps were awful. Starvation, disease and even death prevailed. In 1941, the Japanese, in collaboration with the Nazis, rounded up all the Jews in Shanghai and placed them in a ghetto in Tilanqiao. There were approximately 15,000 Jews left in Shanghai by then. They were also plagued by malnutrition and disease. The ghetto Jews lived in overcrowded multi family homes in one of the poorest sections of Shanghai. When the war ended, most Jews left Shanghai and settled in Australia, the United States or Canada. Most of the Jews living in Shanghai during World War II survived. Aiyi and Ernest escaped first to Texas but ultimately settled in Canada.\\n\\nWeina Dai Randel, the gifted storyteller that she is, was able to weave Shanghai’s history during World War II into her book The Last Rose of Shanghai and couple it with the beautiful, difficult but strong loving relationship that Aiyi and Ernest shared. The Last Rose of Shanghai was a well written historical fiction novel. The themes that ran throughout the novel were love, family, tragedy, prejudice, choices to be made, hope and redemption. It was a powerful and poignant story with vividly drawn characters that processed great depth, complexity and believable feelings. It was easy to imagine the smells, sights, sounds, music, sadness and hope that encompassed Shanghai during the war. I really enjoyed listening to The Last Rose of Shanghai and highly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'I loved, loved, loved this book. I have been completely immersed in wartime Shanghai. It has been an educational, emotional, rollercoaster of a read.\\n\\nAiyi, a wealthy young woman, owns a nightclub in Shanghai. She hires a Jewish refugee, a pianist called Ernest Reisman, who has recently arrived in the city with his younger sister. I had been unaware of the tens of thousands of refugees who fled Europe for Shanghai. This is their story as much as a love story between Aiyi and Ernest, a man she should not be with as it was culturally abhorrent to the Chinese to be with a white person, a Westerner. It is also the story of the struggle and survival of the local Chinese during these terrifying years. Randel writes of the brutality of these times in such a way that the reader is left in no doubt at the horror of life under Japanese occupation. The deprivation, starvation, fear and hopelessness, as well as inner strength of ordinary citizens, is overwhelming and humbling. The ending had me in floods of tears, unable to see the page.\\n\\nThis is a work of fiction but many of the characters such as Emily Hahn, an American journalist, Laura Margolis who led the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee’s efforts to support refugees in Shanghai, and Sir Victor Sassoon who built The Peace Hotel, are real and their life stories are also fascinating.\\n\\nAn easy 5 stars from me. This is a book I will never forget. I visited Shanghai in 2019. It’s a wonderfully vibrant city. The architecture of the restored buildings on the waterfront, including The Peace Hotel, is stunning. I’m ashamed to say now that I had no knowledge of this period of its history.',\n",

       " \"I read lots of World War II books but most of them are about the war in Europe and the reprehensible actions of the German leaders. This book is about life in Shangri during the Japanese invasion. It gave a unique look at how badly the Japanese soldiers treated people during the occupation of China. It's a dual time line book taking place in the 1940s and 1980. The timeline during the war is told by Aiyi and Ernest and the 1960s timeline is told by told by Aiyi Shao and Ernest.\\n\\nAiyi is a 20 year old heiress who is fighting against the wishes of her parents and brothers by owning a jazz club in Shangri. Her family has already picked out a husband for her but she has no intention of getting married and giving up her life and her job even though it was very much against the customs in Shangri where the major goal for women was getting married and having babies. In January of 1940, her club is running out of liquor and she is losing business. She meets Ernest when he helps her escape from some thugs who wanted to punish her for her race. Ernest is a German Jew who has come to Shangri with his younger sister to avoid the persecution of Jewish people in Germany. He used the last of his money to buy tickets on the ship and is hoping that his parents will be arriving soon from Germany. As soon as he gets off the boat, he starts looking for a job and gets turned down everywhere because he's a refugee. He eventually finds work as a piano player at Aiya's club and his talent helps to make it one of the more famous clubs in Shanghai. When she hires him, she is defying customs - there was much prejudice between the Chinese and the white people in the city. The more time they spend together - the more their feelings for each other grow. As the war escalates, they find themselves torn apart and the decisions they need to make will affect both of them for the rest of their lives. Will their love be strong enough to help them overcome the prejudice in Shangri and the war that is becoming part of their everyday lives?\\n\\n\\nThis was a beautifully written novel and it was apparent that the author did significant research. The two main characters were so well written that I felt their pain during the war and their happiness at being together. I learned a lot about the war in China and the treatment of the Chinese by the Japanese soldiers.

       " 'The Last Rose of Shanghai by Weina Dai Randel. Not very often a book leaves me numb and blank at the end as this one does. Right before WW2 things were tense between China and Japan. Japan trying to take control of China. Jobs for foreigners were scarce. Money was flowing through some night clubs while others struggled to find the magic to get recognized. This is what put the magic in for the foreign piano man, Jewish refugee Ernest and Aiji. Their story goes through the occupation of China during WW2 and on through China’s civil war. Their own war to be fought as a foreigner and a Chinese woman fight to be together. Traditions broken, some destroyed forever.',\n",
       " 'This was a super quick read, but there was too much going on. At first I was really captivated by the authors writing style and the idea of an interracial relationship in Shanghai. However, this book has so many twists and turns, it is so unrealistic and very soapy. I honestly felt like I was forcing myself to finish the book toward the end because it seemed to just drag on. At times the plot is very predictable too. It is hard to like any of the characters as I feel they lack depth. I was so hopeful for this book, but it fell flat for me. That being said, if you want a quick, soapy read I would recommend this book.',\n",

I sometimes thought it was written to become a TV miniseries or worse a Hallmark soap opera style TV film. I raised my rating to a 3 based upon the sheer depth of research that was required to learn about Jewish refugees pre and during WWII who ended up in Shanghai - that\\'s not your everyday subject matter and it did require a lot of preparation. The writing was descriptive and fairly easy reading and I enjoyed the descriptions of Shanghai of that era. Now for the \"not so much\" aspects. Parts of their adventures were totally unbelievable. Without resorting to spoilers, let me just state that one of our lead characters, Ernest, is an accomplished pianist and becomes Shanghai\\'s main nightclub attraction as a jazz entertainer, featured in popular magazines etc. However, our main villain, the all-too-sterotypical Japanese military bully, Yamizake, has no way to locate Ernest who hides in plain sight. And there are other events that stretched credulity (when I\\'m reading alone and hear myself blurt out \"Gimme a break\" I think that indicates I wasn\\'t buying it!) One more example without mentioning the characters or situation, how does someone who has never been in the military know instinctively how to drive an army tank? I wouldn\\'t even know how to start it up, is there a key and an ignition? The characters are pretty shallow, I never understood what drove the love interests to each other. In Ernest\\'s case it pretty much was pure lust, in Aiyi\\'s case we never really understood (pretty much because she\\'s not too nice a person.) You\\'ll see the not-too-surprising \"twist\" a mile away. Overall, I stuck with it, kept hoping it would take a turn for the better, but ended up disappointed.

Ernest arrives in Shanghai a 19 year old Jewish refugee from Germany. At the end of the War some 18000 Jewish refugees had settled in Shanghai. Forced to flee the Nazis, ports around the world denied them entry including the US. Aiyi is a Chinese aristocratic 19 year old beautiful club owner and business woman. The first part of the book is very glamourous and paints a picture of a glitzy wealthy Shanghai. As the WWII intensifies in Asia, life deteriorates quickly and the love story becomes tragic. There are many twist and turns and in the end no one is left without personal devastation. I absolutely love this novel about the horrors of war.',\n",

The cultural insights were nice. I’d call this “Joy Luck Club” meets every WWII historical fiction you ever read.

Ernest is a Jewish refugee from Germany, who arrives with his sister, but desperate for work. He intercedes to protect Aiyi when she is attacked, beginning a relationship that lasts throughout the book, as each goes through failures and successes. Ernest is an immensely talented pianist, and helps save her club with his jazz music. What makes this different is the Shanghai city setting, the horrors inflicted on the Chinese by the Japanese, the deplorable living conditions for Jewish immigrants, which were well done by Randel.

The setting and premise were very intriguing: Jews who fled Germany (during WWII) to Shanghai and one refugee falling for a Chinese woman living in Japanese occupied Shanghai. The problem was that the characters were inconsistent (Aiyi was annoying most of the time) and the romance between them was not fleshed out enough for the romance reader that I am. They are kept apart by what felt at times convenience while having them trying to be together in Shanghai and making the best of it would have worked better. The secondary characters also lacked depth, so much so that when tragedy struck I was unmoved. The war setting was not fleshed out either. I mean there is one villain who is harassing them (that seemed far fetched) who keeps popping up but outside of that it was lacking. I mean you have the German and Austrian Jews, the British, the American, the Chinese, the Japanese all living together at first (things evolved) but we didn't feel the tensions enough for me.

       " 'This book was an Amazon First Reads selection, and I picked it because I was intrigued by the story of the Jews of Shanghai after watching a PBS documentary on what their life was like. I went into the book knowing that it was fiction but hoping for some actual insight into the place at that time. Unfortunately, there were a number of issues.\\n\\nFirst, though I give the author credit for writing in a language that is not her first, the writing is not particularly enjoyable. I\\'ve always heard that one of the principal rules of writing is \"Show, don\\'t tell.\" This book has a whole lot of telling and very little showing. Aiyi, our first-person narrator, spends tons of time telling us about how rich she is, what lavish jewelry and clothing she wears, about her nightclub and her servants and the reputation of her family. And yet there are instances when the reader has to infer that something has happened because it isn\\'t explicitly stated that it has. I\\'m thinking of one part here in which a character is shot by a soldier; the book says that the soldier has a gun and that the character is bleeding, but it never actually explains the connection.\\n\\nAnother major issue for me was what I saw as a series of historical inaccuracies. The characters can all conveniently talk to one another, often in fluent English, though they all are from different countries. They talk like modern-day people, too, despite the fact that they\\'re supposed to be living 80 years ago and be from different cultures with different levels of formality and ways of speaking. On at least two occasions, a character is said to be eating a bagel with peanut butter. Peanut butter is hard to find in China today, so I can\\'t imagine it was a common thing in 1940s Shanghai. There is a bit at one part near the end of the book where a character is living in a slum with no running water yet has a plastic stool, and plastics weren\\'t really produced until the 1950s.\\n\\nThen there are details about Jews and Judaism that are off, like Miriam talking about being able to read from the Torah for her bat mitzvah. The author says in her acknowledgments that she consulted a rabbi about bat mitzvah practices in the 20th-century United States, but it\\'s worth noting that even more progressive congregations didn\\'t let girls read from the Torah until much later (my mother, for instance, did not read from the Torah at her bat mitzvah in the mid-1960s). At one point there\\'s a reference to the ashes of a Jewish character who has died; Jews believe the body must be returned to the earth as it came into it, so we do not believe in cremation.\\n\\nEven if I could completely suspend my disbelief and ignore all these inaccuracies, I would still have one major problem with this book: I didn\\'t like the characters or find them to be at all believable. They seem hyper-focused on making money, even in the midst of a world war and an enemy occupation. They are super wishy-washy about their feelings for each other. And the resolution of the story is predictable and frankly unrealistic. I think this book was really meant to be a romance novel, but even taking away the war and the historical setting, it\\'s not a particularly convincing one.\\n\\nI feel a little bad about how hard I am on this book, especially because the author took on a very difficult subject. But I have read my fair share of WWII/Holocaust literature and memoir and had high expectations for this book that were not at all met.',\n",

Each successive entry peels back a layer of the story to ultimately reveal the truth behind the original novel. It sounds great as a premise, but the book as written doesn't quite match the compelling setup. The first problem is that the faux novel is just plain silly, with bursts of melodrama and written in a deliberately stylized manner, like a bad Edith Wharton pastiche. Andrew Bevel, the fictional character who is the subject of all this, is never sympathetic, even behind a façade, so we aren't surprised by later revelations. Showing that a wealthy financier isn't all he's cracked up to be is hardly revelatory. This would have been far more interesting if the first sections presented compelling characters and a myth that readers could get behind, only to strip it away later. Instead, we get a cartoonish setup, uninspiring characters, and an ending we all knew was coming.\",\n",

       " 'Every now and then, when I am lucky, I will come across a novel that will completely blast my readerly expectations from their mooring. These are the novels that disrupt business as usual, that slip from their reviewers’ grasp and revel in making it difficult to talk about them because they refuse to be metabolized into a digestible précis or be reducible to an easy categorization. I am drawn to all the ways these novels do this: refuse to satisfy conventional narrative expectations, defy our sense of what fiction and narrative can and should be, and in doing so reveal the potent and important work of language that cracks open locked doors and brings us face to face with the world that both unites and divides us—and with ourselves.\\n\\nHernan Diaz’s smart, moving and formally daring novel, , is such a novel.\\n\\nIn the widest view, offers a searing look at the gravitational pull of money and its ability to “bend and align reality itself”; in the smallest view, it disorients and disrupts formal genre distinctions to unsettle and resettle the long-standing myths that surround American financial power and excavate the unnamed and faceless histories that are buried beneath their constraining weight.\\n\\nThe structure of might be a good place to begin a cursory investigation of what makes this novel so extraordinary. On its face, tells the story of a wealthy financier and his rise to outrageous monetary heights during the Great Depression of 1929. What follows might have been, in any other novel, a straightforward narrative, like a hammer to a nail: the archetypical tale of the American Dream that highlights the individualism and determination of the “self-made” American man. Diaz, however, fractures that story instead, spilling it across multiple genres: a novel, a memoir draft, a memoir, and finally, a diary. By the time we think we know what the story is about, the frame has already shifted, and the story has become something else. And then something else again. And then something else again. With each turn of the frame, a new angle of glare is revealed. In other words, the frames are not decorative—they are borne out of necessity. They rise out of a deeper silence, and make possible sounds that could not otherwise be articulated. The frames speak against erasure.\\n\\nI am mesmerized by the fierce intelligence with which Diaz addresses multiple facets of this erasure. How its echo, shadow, and silent force permeates the novel’s structure, tone, and theme. Early on, the novel establishes a “truth,” which is to say a story, only to then gradually begin to dismantle it, unwinding it in long threads of half-truths and half-lies across the page, all tangled but legible. In a slow surge, which later becomes a flood, we begin to have an acute sense that there is much more being said than what we are given access to, that there are words behind the words we are reading. Something crucial is being withheld; we are not entirely sure what. This might be frustrating for some readers, but the anticipation of discovery is far more compelling: we must go in to find out.\\n\\nTherein lies, I think, the genuinely subversive quality of this novel (and half the joy of reading it): in its determined attention to the gaps, the silences, the evasions, and how it posits these gaps and silences and evasions—this edge of unfinished business—as a challenge to the reader to find out the truth, and most crucially, to avoid complicity in the erasures effected by the story.\\n\\nMost narratives about money-making and the American dream of the self-sufficient white man are curiously silent about the origins of that money, and what set of conditions make it possible for the white man to remain self-sufficient. This inherent resistance to the topic is borne out of a perverse sense of self-preservation, saving these narratives from having to grapple with (or even acknowledge) any part of the question, either explicit or implied, of whose stolen labor is made serviceable, and what social relations are being concealed, for the realization of that story. It reassures the people and institutions complicit in this erasure, in other words, that they will never have to wake up to their record and face their responsibilities.\\n\\nIt is out of that void that Diaz’s novel leaps, cutting through the bright false stories around it, and asking it plain: whose voice is being heard just by virtue of being loud, and whose voice is stiffened into silence in the violent aftermath? Whose story is being foregrounded, and whose material presence is only dimly perceived or otherwise obscured from view altogether? Whose authoritative gaze is controlling these narratives—what do they reinforce, and what do they consistently fail to see? More important: how does our perception—our too-often easy uncritical acceptance—of what is truth and what is fiction shape our knowledge of ourselves and of the world at large?\\n\\nThese are the open questions that the novel asks us to sit inside and bear witness to. is not necessarily invested in providing all the answers; by the end of the novel, we don’t so much land somewhere as just keep falling. What offers us instead is a plurality of narratives that chart the complexity of our lives and seek to represent the true face of our history. It’s an invitation to reject—or at the very least be skeptical of—the authority of all-encompassing narratives, and to always look for the stories trapped underneath, or otherwise shoved to the ill-lit margins. is an exercise, ultimately, in excavating truth, wherever it’s hidden.

The plot revolves around a successful financier (and his wife) who not only survived the crash of 1929 but thrived and added to their wealth through well-timed investment decisions. He attributes his success to his strong intuitive capabilities, intense research and his acute understanding of the financial world. Needless to say, reaping profits in an era wherein the economy collapsed and investors and businesses lost substantial amounts of money, does invite questions and conjecture directed toward his investment practices, even inspiring fiction based on the life and times of said person with distorted facts and whole a lot of speculation. Now how does one protect his image and manage public perception? Who is he trying to convince? – Those in his close circle? Business associates? Family members? Himself?\\n\\n“Trust” is a complex, layered novel divided into four parts- four distinct narrative styles in four distinct voices. This novel is composed of four intricately woven novels/segments - each presenting a different perspective on the events center to the plot - a work of fiction inspired by the main character and his wife, an incomplete draft of an autobiography written by the egotistical protagonist, a memoir written by the young woman hired by the main character as his biographer and the final segment is a part of the diary of the financier’s late wife. As the narrative progresses, and the line between fact and fiction gets blurred, which version of the events and the people involved rings true? Whose version can you trust?\\n\\nWith its unique structure, elegant writing, interesting characters (even the immensely unlikable protagonist) and the 1920s setting, Hernan Diaz’s Trust is a sharp, compelling and creative work of fiction. The first part of the novel does not quite give the reader an idea of the complexity and the intrigue of the plot that lies ahead.

Here, we learn how she was tasked to craft the autobiography of Bevel, and what Bevel wanted to achieve with it. Also, the Rand-like character of Bevel is contrasted with Ida\\'s dad, an , and her lover, a dedicated opportunist masquerading as a leftist-type of guy. Stuff is said about , and as as someone who studied PoliSci in Karl\\'s hometown, my arm now hurts because of all the facepalming I had to do due to the simplistic ideas about Marxism uttered in this text.\\n\\nIn the last part, Bevel\\'s wife, Mildred (who became Helen as a fictionalized version in part one) gets a say, and we finally learn who she, the person at the heart of the novel, really was - from her point of view, not according to male-dominated fictions. The much discussed plot twist is not really a twist though, because you see it coming from a mile away.\\n\\nMaybe two stars really is too harsh a verdict, because there were passages I enjoyed reading (especially in part three), but the overall narrative idea is way more appealing than the execution. I was missing deeper insights on the belief systems tackled here - unrestrained capitalism, Marxism, Italian anarchism - or the sociopolitical context, or at least the finance system as such. The characters themselves are rendered as ciphers, which is not a problem per se, but then they really have to stand for something complex.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, money is a social construct and a medium: We ascribe value to it in a complex system of social agreements - which is the connection between money and language. This is also the connex between the myth of the American dream and the cult of wealth. But the novel does not really explore these topics, it remains superficial and safe by criticizing Wall Street in an undercomplex manner and turning far-left ideologies into quirky sideshows, and then adds some feminist critique about the role of women when it comes to writing the lives of so-called \"great men\" (a topic widely researched by the first scientist to focus on what we now call toxic masculinity, ). What a missed opportunity.',\n",
       " 'This brilliant metafiction book is about a lot of things, but among the most prominent is the bending and aligning of reality according to one’s mistakes so it ceases to be a mistake. What are the fictions that compose our identity? Or do our lives eventually become the written and verbal fictions that others craft?\\n\\nSince I am an early reader, I had the joy of discovering the alchemy created by Hernan Diaz without any advance knowledge or perceptions. In this review, I’m going to try hard to ensure that others are equally spellbound by some of the more intriguing shifts.\\n\\nAt the start, the author pays evident homage to Edith Wharton in his presentation of the legendary financier Benjamin Rask. In unadorned but elegant prose, we learn the story of Rask’s ascension to the economic stratosphere (of course, it didn’t hurt that he was born into family money) and the influence of his wife, Helen, who hails from a family of old money that is now in a precarious state. So convincing is that portrayal that I actually Googled this couple, and when the results proved lacking, I refreshed and googled again.\\n\\nFor nearly 100 pages, we are immersed in their compelling story but I have to admit I thought, “Okay, good writing that’s rather evocative. But what’s the big deal?”\\n\\nThe “big deal” is revealed through the next three sections – revealed in a novel-within-a-novel, an unfinished manuscript, a memoir, and finally a diary – as other narrators take the stage. As layer upon layer is added, we view the first 100 pages with whole new eyes. Who the narrators are – and what is revealed – is for the reader to discover.\\n\\nCertain themes and motifs begin to repeat. One surrounds the allure of money: is it merely a fiction – a dirty stack of bills that we use as a measure to value all other commodities? Does that then make finance capital a fiction of a fiction? Or is it the god of commodities and the foundation of making all things possible?\\n\\nFor those (to coin Thomas Wolfe) “masters of the universe”, how do we separate the ever-present myths from the realities? Where do the women who stand with them fit in? Why force women into stereotypes , putting them in their place for the purpose of providing a better story of themselves for history? And finally, are we all complicit in the stories we create if the price is high enough?\\n\\nThe more I consider this novel, the more blown away I am with it. It is an exhilarating read that goes to the very core of distinguishing fact from fiction. I owe a debt of gratitude to Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, for providing me with the privilege of being an advance reader in exchange for an honest review. I’ve no doubt this book will make my Top Ten this year.',\n",
       " 'Hernan Diaz’s new book, “Trust,” is about an early-20th-century investor. Or at least it seems to be. Everything about this cunning story makes a mockery of its title. The only certainty here is Diaz’s brilliance and the value of his rewarding book.\\n\\nThough framed as a novel, “Trust” is actually an intricately constructed quartet of stories — what Wall Street traders would call a 4-for-1 stock split.\\n\\nThe first part is a novella titled “Bonds,” presented as the work by a now forgotten writer in the 1930s named Harold Vanner. A pastiche of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s and Edith Wharton’s fiction, the story luxuriates in the tragic fate of America’s wealthiest man, Benjamin Rask. The opening line immediately signals the narrator’s mingled awe and reproof: “Because he had enjoyed almost every advantage since birth, one of the few privileges denied to Benjamin Rask was that of a heroic rise.”\\n\\nDiaz, writing as Vanner, spins the legend of an icy, isolated young man who quickly masters the levers of finance to transform his “respectable inheritance” into an unimaginably large estate. “His colleagues thought him. . . .',\n",
       " 'Now joint Pulitzer Prize winner.\\n\\n12th in my 2022 Booker Prize longlist rankings - my Bookstagram rating, ranking, summary review and Book themed Golden Retriever photo is here: https://www.instagram.com/p/Chgs5vzs-...\\n\\nThis is a tale which bridges two cultures (art/literature and high finance), but which is very much a book of two halves (the first almost deliberately weak, the second intriguing) and which left me in two minds (hence my rating – a mix of a 4*+ concept and a 2* execution).\\n\\nCP Snow famously wrote an article/lecture/essay book on the chasm that had opened between the cultures of arts and science – in my view (and as someone with a foot in both camps) there is a similar divide now between the worlds of literary fiction and finance. If you can find someone in finance who reads they are likely to read non-fiction books with possible some genre fiction – and similarly few literary fiction books even cover finance. Of those that do many seem to misunderstand it (for example confusing the direction of interest rate change impacts) – and even my book of 2022 Natasha Brown’s “Assembly” uses banking as a canvas on which to focus a social mobility/meritocracy lens on the topic of colonialism and its lasting impacts (eg we do not know what job the unnamed narrator does for her bank – just her seniority).\\n\\nSo I welcome this book’s explicit aim to address that divide and to provide a literary exploration of capital, investment and banking and via one dictionary definition of the title. The author has further stated his aim as examining and deconstructing one of the foundational myths/classic American narratives of American society (the role of free market capitalism and the investment markets and particularly the self-made wealthy entrepreneur) in the same way that his first novel “In The Distance” did with the Western.\\n\\nAt the same time the author wanted to examine the other definition of Trust and in particular the idea of the trust that it is implicit in fiction and reading\\n\\nBecause this is a book written in four very different parts – each with a different writer, a different narrative voice, a different style and a different purpose. The Washington Post and leading Goodreads reviewer Ron Charles in his review says this quartet of very different stories is – thus illustrating perfectly my contended literature/finance divide, given that split into four identical parts is almost the exact opposite to what Diaz does. Interesting though I think some form of more identical split would have worked much better here (see later).\\n\\nThe book starts with around a 100 page pastiche of (or possibly tribute to) Edith Wharton and her fiction which not only documented the Gilded Age of America but which was towards the end of the literary realism movement – a novel called “Bonds” by Harold Vanner which tells the story of a Wall Street banker/trader/tycoon Benjamin Rask – his taking advantage of the 1920s bull market and then his more controversial role in the 1929 Crash; alongside the story of his art patron/philanthropist wife Helen and her mental instability and treatment for that in Europe.\\n\\nThe second section is around a 100 page pastiche (and in this case definitely not a tribute to) the self-aggrandising (if unfinished) business autobiography of a Wall Street banker/trader/tycoon Andrew Revel – his role in growing the nation’s prosperity by helping the 1920s bull market and then his saddened realisation that speculation had driven the market too high leading him to evade the 1929 Crash; alongside the story of his art patron/philanthropist late-wife Mildred and her emotional and mental stability ahead of her treatment for cancer in Europe.\\n\\nThe third section (and easily the strongest of the book) is written by Ida Partenza – the daughter of an Italian anarchist effectively in America as a political refugee – she is hired by Revel to write the second part of the novel as a counterbalance to the sensationalist impact of the first (which he and everyone else regards as his lightly fictionalised biography). While researching the book (to the limited permitted by Revel who wishes to tightly control the narrative) Ida finds that neither Vanner or Revel’s portrayal of Mildred seems to meet the complexity of her character but is unable to discover the true Mildred. Parts of this section are narrated closer to our present day as the now elderly Ida visits a museum made of the Revel home (where she wrote her book) and explores the archives.\\n\\nThe fourth and shortest part of the book (albeit still much stronger than the first two) is Ida’s final discovery – a very fragmentary diary written by Mildred before her death, while being treated in Europe, which contains a revelation as to the real story of Revel (and his roles in both the bull market and crash) which to be honest has been pretty easy to guess from the beginning.\\n\\nAs I have implied this is a book of two halves – the first two sections for me were very weak although mercifully easy to skip through at a quick pace, as my brother’s review says . In the first section in particular I started writing down passages and turns of phrase that annoyed me before deciding to go for the pastiche rather than tribute option. What I was less clear on was the author’s decision to lead with the entirety of the two sections rather than having the four sections interleaved through the novel. I believe the aim was to draw the reader into each story and to the world it posits before revealing another layer of the story – but neither for me was sufficiently well written to draw me in so spoiling the effect. Further there are by now myriad mainstream media and Goodreads reviews which make the set up of the first two parts (as revealed in the third) clear which also negated any impact of revelation – and in some ways that is anyway to the book’s benefits as I think many modern readers taking the first section (at least) on face value may well have bailed.\\n\\nI am sure there is a point for this – as the book itself says .\\n\\nThe obviousness of the “reveal” in the fourth section I can live with better – as the book seems to strongly signpost this by discussing (on two separate but importantly linked occasions) someone recounting a detective style novel and someone else (older or wiser) having to effectively pretend that the reveal of the murderer is a surprise.\\n\\nThere is though a lot to like in the novel in terms of its concept – both at a macro and more micro level.\\n\\nOn the overall level I liked (while not thinking it entirely worked) the ideas of linking the sustained and collective illusion (or perhaps collective decision to place collective faith in a narrative) that lies behind not just fictional stories themselves, but non-fictional accounts, behind national (and national identity) stories, behind political movements and also behind financial markets.\\n\\nOn the micro level I enjoyed for example: the exploration of the marginalisation of (and even worse co-opting or blatant stealing of) female voices and ideas; the idea that a blend of human psychology with mathematical analysis is key to investment success (and it reminded me of the intersection of art-empathy-gut call & data-science-hard facts at the heart of commercial insurance underwriting); the fragmentary ideas in the fourth section about the transition from literary realism to literary modernism (and its equivalent in music).\\n\\nMy thanks to Panmacmillan for an ARC via NetGalley',\n",
       " \"Joint winner of the Pulitzer Prize\\n\\nWhich doesn’t suggest American fiction is in a very healthy state.\\n\\nTrust by Hernan Diaz has an interesting, and in some respects brave, structure, albeit one that many readers have commented seems to have been borrowed from Susan Choi's Trust Exercise, which is perhaps a clever metafictional approach given metafictional clumsiness is at the heart of the novel, as is the theme of men taking credit for women's achievements.\\n\\nThe second best way to read this book might to be to do without foreknowledge of this structure, but the high level of publicity and authorial interviews makes that difficult, and so I will cover it in my review. Although the best way might be not to read it at all - of a book published at the same time, does something similar but is much more accomplished.\\n\\nThe novel is split into four parts, three of them novellas and the last a brief coda:\\n\\nBonds by Harold Vanner\\nMy Life by Andrew Bevel\\nA Memoir Remembered by Ida Partenza\\nFutures by Mildred Bevel\\n\\nBonds is the loosely fictionalised biography (fictional even within the novel's world) of a 1920-30s Wall Street tycoon Benjamin Rask and his wife Helen, published (in the novel's world) in the early 1930s. It is written in the style of an Edith Wharton, although Vanner (and perhaps also Diaz?) is a poor imitator of her prose, and the novella is (deliberately?) badly written.\\n\\nRask is based on the real-life (in the novel's world - I will stop adding that for fear of this review becoming as tedious as Vanner's prose) Andrew Bevel, whose late wife was called Mildred. And who I kept wanting to call Mildred Revel as my Proustian recollection of those delicious chocolates - except the coffee one - was the only good thing from the book.\\n\\nAnd My Life is Bevel's own autobiographical account, designed to counter Vanner's scurrilous portrayal, both of Andrew Bevel's part in the late 1920s Wall Street crash but also Vanner's version of Mildred, who Vanner has dying after severe mental health problems, but who Vanner portrays as a simple, but kindly soul. Or rather My Life is a partly completed account, with lots of 'add some anecdotes here' type comments left in the manuscript for example:\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain this isn't a great read as the tone is deliberately rather pompous and (disappointingly) in both sections, the details of the operation of the stock market during the fascinating memoir are as sketchy as parts of Bevel's incomplete work. Hence my 'brave' comment earlier - for the reader, a pastiche of a badly written book is still a badly written book. Although both Bonds and My Life are quick reads, ideally skimmed, as there is seldom a word which isn't wasted.\\n\\nThe third part is the novel's “highlight” although that is damning with faint praise. Ida Partenza proves to be Bevel's typist (as he would have seen her) or ghost-writer (in reality), responsible for My Life. In A Memoir Remembered she is recounting, decades later, how she became involved with Bevel and with his autobiography. Parts of this story were compelling, although a side story involving her jealous boyfriend, a journalist, seemed more designed to set up part four of the book, rather than add anything, and that of her Italian anarchist father felt like it belonged to another book.\\n\\nThe reminisces on the past in A Memoir Remembered are interspersed with Partenza's account of contemporary visit to the Bevel's former home, now turned into a museum. There she finds a diary written by Mildred Bevel.\\n\\nAnd the novel's brief final section is that diary, written from the Swiss sanitorium where Mildred (and Helen, albeit from a different cause) ended her days. And this section contains a revelation that had been heavy-handedly signposted throughout - again this seems to be deliberately.\\n\\nUltimately, very disappointing, at times deliberately so. 1 star - rounded down for its apperance on an otherwise strong Booker list.\\n\\nThanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the ARC.\",\n",

That's what all those criminals trade in: fictions... Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we've all agreed to support. Unanimously.\\n\\nThis is such a smart book, and smart in all kinds of ways. The central trope draws parallels between capitalism, especially financial instruments, and fiction - and those images and ideas proliferate throughout the book.\\n\\nAlong the way we have a central story that gets undermined, inverted and investigated through connected texts; we have assertions about the representation of gender in writing and the worn-out conventions that imprison women within certain comfortable roles; and we get a host of literary references and allusions from Henry James and Edith Wharton, to Woolf and Barrett Browning, to Plath ('a bell in a bell jar won't ring') and even Rebecca Solnit's .\\n\\nDiaz is especially concerned with American-based capitalism with the Wall Street setting and the accusation of wealth built upon slavery but the points transfer all too easily beyond the US.

If you did, chances are you are a foreign exchange (Forex) trader. You can look up the richest current day Forex traders. Leading the pack is George Soros with a new worth of $8.6 billion.\\n\\nFor the average working stiff grinding it out in an office or behind a counter, in a factory or on a construction site, such astronomical sums of money exist in a different universe.\\n\\nHernan Diaz\\'s absorbing novel examines the world of kingpin financiers back in the 1920s and 1930s. Ah, the power and magic of money.\\n\\ncontains a four part structure: a novel, an autobiography, a memoir and a diary. Since readers are best discovering the twists and surprises while turning the pages, I\\'ll avoid dropping any spoilers by zeroing in on several choice specifics:\\n\\n\\nHernan Diaz acknowledges Henry James as a prime influence. , Diaz\\'s fictional novel within his novel, is authored by one Harold Vanner. It might be a stretch but I couldn\\'t help thinking of another author with a similar name: Hugh Vereker, the novelist in James\\' , where sage Vereker divulges his big secret to a young literary critic: his central authorial purpose undergirds all of his writing, like a complex figure in a Persian carpet. I kept wondering if, by having as his first part, Hernan Diaz was, in turn, indirectly pointing to his authorial purpose in writing . Hint: Think in terms of fiction influencing history along with history influencing fiction.\\n\\n“Because he had enjoyed almost every advantage since birth” - Harold Vanner\\'s novel about Benjamin Rask opens with these words. We come to learn how Rask used advantages of inherited wealth and his special gifts for mathematics and finance to become on of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Indeed, applying discipline and creativity, Rask can been seen as a variation on Hermann Hesse\\'s Magister Ludi - but instead of the Glass Bead Game, Rask\\'s sophisticated game revolves around reading stock market ticker tape. And he doesn\\'t even have to travel to Wall Street; rather, Rask can maneuver stock transactions from the privacy of his townhouse on West 17th Street.\\n\\nThe plot thickens when Rask marries Helen Brevoort, a young lady who possesses special gifts of her own. However, Helen also has serious health problems. The bulk of Vanner\\'s later chapters provides the gruesome, grisly details.\\n\\nThus we have the tale of Benjamin Rask, financial genius, husband, philanthropist, cornerstone of a great, booming American economy. But, but, but...reading between the lines, we can detect what the novel does not address: things like the institution of slavery, the decimation of Native Americans, the brutalization and exploitation of waves of immigrant populations, the pollution and destruction of huge swaths of land and water. Perhaps this unspoken dimension speaks to Hernan Diaz asking readers to question the framework and underlying assumptions of all historical accounts whatever their form: novels, biography, historical treatises, history textbooks.\\n\\n\\nIn the second section of , we read about the life of a real financier – Andrew Bevel (real, that is, in the context of Hernan Diaz\\'s novel). There is a particular reason Bevel wants to recap his odyssey as one of the leading men of his age, a reason relating to Harold Vanner\\'s novel. Again, so as to avoid spoilers, I\\'ll focus on a few specific passages, as per -\\n\\n“During this time I saw not only the destiny of our great nation fulfilled but also of my own.”\\n\\nMuch of Bevel\\'s autobiography amounts to a paean to American capitalism. Bevel goes to great lengths to proclaim an individual\\'s success and the good of the country are one and the same. Sounds like someone is living in the bubble of his own mythology. To note one of the many, many instances where individual profit and the common good are contrary: the Sackler family and the pharmaceutical industry made a fortune by getting millions of Americans hooked on OxyContin.\\n\\n“Woman represented only 1.5 per cent of the dilettantish speculators at the beginning of the decade (1920s). At the end they neared 40 per cent. Could there have been a clearer indicator of the disaster to come?”\\n\\nBevel\\'s misogyny is almost laughable. When in doubt, place the blame on women. Bevel is writing this in the early 1940s, where the world of serious business has always been the exclusive domain of men. Of course, white men.\\n\\n“I have a scientific approach to business. Every investment requires profound knowledge of a myriad of specific details.”\\n\\nSure, Bevel, you\\'re very scientific but, as we find out in later sections of the novel, Bevel is also a narrow-minded, self-serving scumbag and, even worse, a criminal. Guy should have been put behind bars.\\n\\n“All of us aspire to great wealth.”\\n\\nDo we all, Bevel? The ultimate in arrogance: assuming everyone on the planet values what he values, Bevel carries on as if the financier combined with the Protestant work ethic is the final stage of human evolution. Pathetic.\\n\\n\\nThe two preceding sections are interesting but with this third section where writer Ida Partenza reflects back on the dramatic turning point in her younger life, picks up steam and becomes a page-turner.\\n\\n\"Fiction harmless? Look at religion. Fiction harmless? Look at the oppressed masses content with their lot because they have embraced the lies imposed on them. History itself is just a fiction - a fiction with an army. And reality? Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget. That\\'s what it is. And how is reality funded? With yet another fiction: money. Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we\\'ve all agreed to support. Unanimously.\"\\n\\nSo speaks Ida to her father in their rundown Brooklyn apartment. One could read as an amplification of Ida\\'s words here. So much so I\\'ll conclude with a recommendation: Pick up this Hernan Diaz novel and read with an eye to the final two sections. We shouldn\\'t be surprised it takes a pair of very perceptive, sensitive, intelligent women to sort things out.\\n\\n\\nHernan Diaz, born 1970',\n",
       " \"I love narratives about narratives, stories within stories, and TRUST is an excellent example of the genre that is also one of the most straightforward. I know some readers dislike a feeling of manipulation or bait and switch when they find one narrative to contradict the other, but while those things happen in this book, the book also isn't interested in pulling the rug. It is quite clear about what each section is, and it illuminates as you go.\\n\\nI do want to provide one important note: it was a good thing I saw the accolades for this before I started because at first I wasn't sure what the big deal was and it's very possible I would have put it down. The first part does feel rather like Wharton, a story of a prestigious and tragic wealthy family in New York. The second part had me once again going back to confirm that everyone loved this book, because I was immediately wrinkling my nose at the tedious, self-involved memoir of a man in finance, who bore a strong resemblance to the man in the first story. But I powered through and I wanted to let you know that you will be rewarded for doing so. The second part is supposed to be that grating and it will be worth getting through it.\\n\\nI admit that I do not read many books by cis men these days (my excuse is hilariously the same excuse of the many cis men who read almost entirely cis men--that I let my interests guide my reading) and when I do I have noticed more books with female protagonists as they begin to reckon with patriarchy, though sometimes it is just acknowledging rather than reckoning. This frustrates me more than it pleases me. Plenty of women write about women like this, it is unclear what these men are contributing or what they're trying to say. I would much rather see men grapple with their role in patriarchy directly, but I rarely do. And then this book came along. It is a book about capitalism, the financial system, and wealth, but it is also a story about how men become the heroes of these stories. This book is very smart in how it engages with patriarchy and misogyny, showing us not just the wealthy exploiting the work and care of women. It also uses the voices of men and, ultimately, women as well. The echo of a man telling a woman's story put up against the work women do to tell men's stories bounce back and forth off each other like two mirrors held parallel. I was so satisfied by the end, this is exactly the kind of interesting writing that I have been wanting but mostly not getting from men writing literary fiction.\\n\\nNot a puzzle box, really (after all, the table of contents tells you the four parts and their authors) but still giving you the pleasures of new context making the story deeper and richer as you go.\\n\\nThere were some elements of the final section that were too clear for my liking, I would have liked them weaved in in a way that fit the rest of the prose and style. Felt a bit clunky for how expertly done the rest is. But that is also me being a devoted reader of puzzle box stories looking for subtlety and surprise. By the final section you already suspect what you will read, so it is not really a surprise after all.\",\n",

The subsequent parts want to answer how much of that fiction was real and look at the schemes that people with power have to build and impose their versions of events.\\n\\nBy the time we get to find out the truth, I don\\'t think that it matters as strongly as Hernan Diaz thinks. The power of fiction is stronger than the truth here.\\n\\nIn Hernan Diaz words :\"Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget.\" Maybe Trust was too ambitious, maybe it does exactly what is supposed to do. The hype is real. For now, for me, Trust is the best book published this year.',\n",

This is a structurally tricky novel, with a book within a book, a fictional family and a “real” family and a final section that strips away whatever conclusions you have already drawn.

       " 'Trust was the latest historical fiction novel by Hernan Diaz following his debut novel, In the Distance, a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2017. Trust was longlisted for The Booker Prize 2022. In this book, Hernan Diaz focuses on wealthy New Yorkers in much the same way as done by Edith Wharton and F. Scott Fitzgerald. An interesting aspect, the reasons becoming clearer as the book progresses, is that the book contains four distinct sections, the first being a novel written by fictitious author Harold Vanner and entitled This novella within the book narrates the story of wealth in New York at the time of the Great Depression. As one becomes immersed in the lives of Benjamin and Helen Rask, a wealthy bonds trader and tycoon on Wall Street and his beautiful wife very involved with her philanthropic endeavors in the arts and music and the library. But a scandal arises as Benjamin Rask is accused of manipulating the market in such a way that the Rasks emerged from the crash of 1929 largely unscathed. And questions abound, how did he know? what kinds of manipulations were employed? was there a formula? did he cause the stock market to crash by selling short?\\n\\nBut we are just beginning as we embrace the second part of a memoir by Andrew Bevel, the man depicted in the fictional as Benjamin Rask. This memoir, much of it just notes as to thoughts and ideas gives us another glimpse into the notorious bonds trader Andrew Bevel and his beautiful wife, Mildred. Bevel is determined to set the record straight after the libelous book was published. As much more information is fed into the mix, one begins to question previous beliefs as we formulate new questions and new areas of inquiry. And the plot thickens.\\n\\nBut at the heart of this novel, is the third part, a memoir by Ida Partenza, the immigrant daughter of an Italian anarchist, a printer and typesetter, putting his skills to good use in America. She tells the story as a woman in her seventies of her life and eventual employment as a young woman as private secretary to Andrew Bevel. This narrative is riveting as we see the view from the top floors in Manhattan through her eyes. But the final section is the narrative by Mildred Bevel, and that puts this chaos all in order.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately I found this novel boring. I don’t have much to say – the characters felt uninspired, the writing dull, and the plot/frame device of a novel within a novel too clunky for my taste.

       " \"Longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize\\n\\nIn his sophomore novel, Hernan Diaz plays with form in intriguing, if not somewhat simplistic ways. The idea of not getting the 'full story' or context, especially in the light of history and certain roles that are or are not given credit, is one of the major themes of the novel.\\n\\nI'm wary to say too much about the plot of this book in fear of 'spoiling' the reading experience. Essentially the story moves from fiction to memoir to journals of various 'characters' as we begin to uncover 'truth' and how its relayed by various writers of history, from novelists to titans of industries.\\n\\nIf that's confusing, stick with it. It's actually quite a readable, accessible novel. Diaz's writing is clear and concise. I found myself consistently interested in each section as it shifted perspective and tone. He writes well enough to differentiate the four sections of this novel, through genre and narrative voices that are distinct from one another.\\n\\nHowever, I felt the end of the novel left me underwhelmed. I felt like this is a book about the journey, not the destination, and once you've taken that journey once, there doesn't seem to be a lot left to meditate on. It also thematically felt familiar. The idea that there are often truths kept in the dark, especially to benefit men throughout history, doesn't seem quite surprising in 2022.\",\n",

Missing from the crash site are the pilot’s flightbag, the plane’s black box, and the tenth passenger. But how?

       " '‘I am not afraid of death. I am afraid of no longer living.’\\n\\nThe 19th century American west has been mined for as many stories as it was gold and silver. The stories typically call to mind (white) men in heroic gun fights that end in dust and blood and glory, though the last few years have seen some excellent re-examinations of the Western genre to expand the horizons of who’s stories are told. , the impressive debut novel by Jenny Tinghui Zhang, is a fresh approach to 19th century Wild West framed around the and violence towards Chinese labororers told through the eyes of a young Chinese woman brought by force to the United States. The novel reads with the spirit of an epic, spanning continents and years in Daiyu’s life as they are thrust into perilous situation after perilous situation from being kidnapped and sold into sex work to disguising themself as a man to navigate the violent white man’s world of 19th century Idaho. While a bit uneven in tone and pacing, is a fascinating debut that feels well researched and adds an important voice into stories of history and makes for a harrowing reading experience bursting full of poetic language and interpersonal insights.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nThis novel comes at a time when another uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes has become major headline news and anti-Chinese sentiments lurk about. In an , Zhang says writing the novel during the early months of the COVID pandemic ‘’ Which is all very distressing how little changes. And while the same hatred still creeps about today, the novel is very much about a period in history and gives a fresh look at the Western genre and period of American history from a new vantage point.\\n\\nDaiyu’s life is one of seemingly endless abrupt turns. Orphaned at an early age, Daiyu seemingly lives multiple lives over the span of this novel, disguised as a boy named Feng working for a calligraphy teachers before being kidnapped and sent to be a sex worker in San Francisco, and then later discussed as a man. The frequent shift makes self-identity an unstable land territory. ‘’ she wonders, ‘’ To guide her along the way, Daiyu is often visited by the spirit of her namesake, ( 林黛玉), who comes from , an 18th century manuscript by considered one of the . In the story, Lin Daiyu is orphaned and when, due to trickery, she witnesses her love marry another woman she dies, and her frequent visitations during times of difficulty become a reminder to the real Daiyu to be strong and not allow herself to be destroyed. ‘’ Daiyu tells us, ‘’ Through each transformation and each moment of pure destruction upon her life, Daiyu continues to resurrect like a phoenix, becoming a figure larger than life and walk amongst the myths and legends of the West.\\n\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nThe altering identities often serve to examine power structures around gender binaries, such as how men (particularly white men) seem to have access to violence while society looks the other way as long as it is directed at someone socially deemed beneath them (by race, class, or if they are a woman). While disguised as a man to be able to navigate the patriarchal society, Daiyu often reflects on what this means to inhabit the space of a man:\\n\\nThe novel does seem to avoid any relationship towards trans identities, in case you were looking for that, or any queer aspects as well. Daiyu does find a romantic outlet in the later half of the novel but it is thwarted simply because he believes she is a man.\\n\\nThough while enjoying the privileges being male presenting gives in a patriarchal society, Daiyu quickly discovers that her race marks her as an Other, a threat, and as less-than-human in the eyes of the white society. ‘’ she reflects, ‘’ The aspects of racial violence will have your stomach in knots, Zhang truly delivers a sense of dread and discomfort as she examines how even with best attempts at assimilation, whiteness will play gatekeeper to the point of violence at every opportunity. This is only emboldened by the Chinese Exclusion Act, which propels the later portion of the novel towards its bloody and tense climax that resonates with an emotionally charged grimness that feels like the Coen brothers would want to film it.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nMy favorite aspects of the novel are Zhang’s incredible phrasing and poetic languages and the musings on art and creation. The lessons here are incredible, take a look:\\n\\nThe examination of the calligraphy functions as a metaphor for the pursuit of the Self in many ways, as the notion of becoming art through your being is a recurring motif in the novel. This also becomes insightful to the multiple layers and dynamic character building of the narrator as each adopted identity compiles together. Though, even if only taken on a surface level, the lessons on being an artist are just as instructive and inspiring:\\n\\nIt is a bit unfortunate that the novel itself occasionally does not live up to it’s own instructions. I found the tone and pacing to be rather uneven, with the interim sequences often needing a push and overly caught up in their own details at the same time as I found each segment of Daiyu’s life to feel underdeveloped and skipped through too quickly. The novel is impressively well researched but sometimes the details eat the scenery and it feels almost too close to itself and belaboring the individual moments without flowing from one to the next as smoothly as it could have. This is a novel of important lessons and voices though, the tone of it for me felt it could have leaned into its own darkness more instead of seeming uncertain which tone to take. There is a lot of telling at the expense of showing, particularly when it is making a point it wants you to know is about something bad (it does not tip into trauma porn though, but readers seeking content warnings should be advised violence and sexual assault are frequent) and many aspects felt overworked. Part of this may be from having just read and for the similar scenes these two books share I felt did some of them more effectively (to be clear they are very different histories, but similar moments). This did not detract from enjoying the moments things really connect, it just could have all meshed more effectively.\\n\\nis a lovely debut with a lot of heart and a wonderful depth of knowledge and history. Especially of a history that often gets swept under the rug. As poet and writer says in her memoir , ‘’ Jenny Tinghui Zhang is a fresh and necessary voice, with a powerful prose subverting the idea of novels of the Wild West and delivering a wonderful and dynamic heroine for us to follow and root for. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I will be eager for their next book.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘’',\n",

The prose is beautiful and the characters memorable. Despite its slow start, the novel is evenly paced and at no point did I lose interest in Daiyu’s story. The episodes of brutality Daiyu witnessed and experienced in the course of her jouney are difficult to read. The author’s narrative tone in some parts might be interpreted by some as stilted or detached but I thought that the occasional factual, clipped tone of the narrative suited the story that was being told. I loved the segments on Chinese calligraphy and the description and symbolism of the different Chinese characters which are shared in the text. The author does a brilliant job in depicting Daiyu’s emotional growth through the years - from a trafficked child of thirteen in 1883 to a young girl who while admitting that she is safer dressed as a man also struggles with her feelings about Nelson, the young violin teacher she meets in Pierce. Daiyu’s interactions with the spirit of her fictional namesake Lin Daiyu that act as her inner voice and conscience throughout her journey, are depicted with much feeling and emotion as are Daiyu’s memories of Master Wang’s teachings and how she applies those principles in her life. The author also sheds a light on the xenophobia, racially-motivated violence and vigilantism that Chinese immigrants had to endure post the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 . The Page Act of 1875, which preceded the Chinese Exclusion Act and prohibited the entry of Chinese women into the United States is also mentioned. The author was inspired by true events, which she discusses in detail in her notes at the end of the book. Extremely well-researched and beautifully penned, this is a brilliant debut and I will be looking out for more of this author’s work in the future.\\n\\n“A line can only be called strong when it has the conviction to stay on paper. Strong lines are important, but how does one make a strong line with a soft brush? Answer: resilience. A resilient brush is one that, after depositing ink on paper, can spring back up in preparation for the next stroke. But resilience is not achieved by pressing harder.

       " 'Thank you to Flatiron and NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review!\\n\\nFirst off, as a reader of Chinese descent, I am so happy to support an author of Chinese descent. The best historical fiction novels uncover a forgotten part of history, and this book definitely did that for me. Although I had previously learned about the Chinese Exclusion Act and the influx of Chinese immigration to America during that time, I had mistakenly believed that laws at the time prevented Chinese women from leaving China. I had not known about the plight of girls and women who were kidnapped and sent to America to work in brothels. Thank you to the author for teaching me about this neglected part of history!\\n\\nFour Treasures of the Sky by Jenny Tinghui Zhang is a brutal and unflinching historical fiction novel about a 13 year-old girl who is kidnapped from China and sent to America with other Chinese girls to work in a brothel. Eventually, she escapes and disguises herself as a boy so that she won\\'t get preyed on by perverts on the street. She finds work and makes friends and allies, but she must also deal with growing discrimination and racism against Chinese immigrants that resulted in many instances of violence and death. The story definitely doesn\\'t shy away from violence and sensitive topics, including sexual assault, so if you are triggered and/or would prefer not to read about these topics, you should take that into consideration.\\n\\nHere is an excerpt from the beginning of Chapter 1:\\n\\n\"When I am kidnapped, it does not happen in an alleyway. It does not happen in the middle of the night. It does not happen when I am alone.\\nWhen I am kidnapped, I am thirteen and standing in the middle of the Zhifu fish market on Beach Road, watching a fleshy woman assemble white fish the shape of spades into a pile. The woman squats, her knees in her armpits, rearranging the fish so the best ones rise to the top.\\n...\\nThe whole place smells wet and raw.\\nSomeone yells about red snapper. Fresh, they say. Straight from the Gulf of Pechili. Another voice tumbles over that one, louder, brighter. Real shark fin! Boost sexual potency, make skin better, increase energy for your little emperor!\"\"\\n\\nOverall, Four Treasures of the Sky is a well-researched historical fiction novel that also added elements of Chinese myths, specifically in the form of a deity that shared Daiyu\\'s name who talks to her sometimes. There is a lot to admire here, particularly the meticulous research that the author conducted in order to write accurately about the experiences of a Chinese girl in America during this time. Unfortunately, reading this book was not an enjoyable experience. I had to take off 2 stars because of the unrelenting violence and threats of rape that the main character experiences. Imagine if the Mulan movie, which had similar cross-dressing themes, ended with Mulan defeated by the Huns, never able to see her family again, and no happily ever after romance with Shang. Even if it was a historically dark and depressing time, I want to be able to feel hope or at least some happiness while reading a novel. Nevertheless, if you are intrigued by the excerpt above, or if you enjoy reading historical fiction, you can check out this book when it comes out in April 2022.',\n",

       " '[4+] I was enthralled with \"Four Treasures of the Sky\" from the opening pages to the epilogue. Superbly and imaginatively written, the narrative follows a young Chinese woman in the late 1800s who is kidnapped and brought to the US. The perils of surviving as a Chinese woman in the US, are heartbreakingly brought to life - particularly the impact of anti-Chinese sentiment after the Chinese Exclusion Act.',\n",
       " \"At the end of this novel, is a very informative and interesting author’s note about how the story is based on a real life unexplained event. I wish that this author’s note was at the beginning of the story instead of the end, so I could better prepare myself for what is to come, which is a story of emotional devastation caused by the real life actions of our own history as Americans.\\n\\nThe novel follows Daiyu, whos difficult life in China becomes an even more difficult life in America when she is kidnapped off the streets and forced to immigrate into the sex trade.\\n\\nThe novel has an amazing beauty which perfectly mixes hope and tragedy throughout the story. While the story could almost feel exploitative in lesser hands, Zhang’s writing never makes it feel that way. It always felt like a real life story that happened and needed to be told.\\n\\nThe magical realism interspersed within the story is often something that I am not a huge fan of but felt like it worked here completely. Daiyu has asides talking to the ‘ghost’ of her namesake. It was a great narrative way to express the trauma and loneliness she herself is facing.\\n\\nDaiyu is a wonderful and beautiful character who throughout her journey never really loses her sense of hope and wonder or her ability to love and be kind even when faced with the worst of people. She represents the best of youth and character and you want the absolute best for her. The side characters involved are written richly and create a great sense of a real community which is facing such deep opposition to their very existence.\\n\\nThis book is obviously filled with tons of deeper and darker subjects. I knew very little about the Chinese Exclusion Acts. I remember learning that people from China immigrated to build railroads and then…that’s it. That’s as far as it went for schooling. This story focuses on the exploitation, racism, and segregation that the Chinese community faced after traveling all this way to a supposed land of hope. Daiyu is also dragged into the sex trade and this form of abuse is focused on in the beginning half of the book.\\n\\nIt's a dark and tragic story but it is absolutely beautiful while telling it. I would recommend reading this with a few tissues handy. This is also a debut novel which is AMAZING. I will definitely be looking out for this author in the future.\\n\\nThank you to Netgalley and Macmillan Audio for a copy of this audiobook.

My reason for picking it up was to learn more about the Chinese Exclusion Act, but what kept me reading was this layered story that tugged at my heart start to finish! I loved the poetic writing! I think what kept me from giving it a perfect 5 stars is that this book was set in the late 1800’s but it felt too modern at times. I don’t know if that makes sense. It just felt like too modern and not so “old fashioned.” I loved the authors note at the end, I think that was what really helped around out my review! So many incidences that happened in the story were true, which made it even more heartbreaking. The audio was really well done.',\n",

       " 'Happy release day!\\nThank you to Netgalley and Macmillan Audio for an advanced audio copy of Four Treasures of the Sky. This title drops on April 5th and if you enjoy historical fiction and a lens thrown on rarely-spotlighted history, it is for you.\\n\\nThis is a book that hits hard in the emotions and doesn’t stop hitting. It holds up a mirror to the average white American and says “did your history class cover this?” and no, my classes certainly did not. This book hurt to read, but it hurts more to know that mainstream American education just omits so much of our worst doings. It is relentlessly grim, readers should know, but I don’t think that’s a reason to knock significant stars off your review, as I’ve seen others do.\\n\\nLin Daiyu is a girl named after a tragic romance heroine in perhaps a significant foreshadowing of Daiyu’s own fate. When she is suddenly left to fend for herself, without family or connections, she dresses as a boy and makes her way to a calligraphy school to find shelter and a living. There her worldview and frame of reference are shaped by the eloquent lessons calligraphy teach her. The different radicals that go into a Chinese character, every stroke coalescing into a beautiful little almost-poem, inform Daiyu’s narration as she struggles to make sense of the cruel world around her. I enjoyed how much calligraphy would come up later, how it is a consistent line through the plot.\\n\\nI listened to the audio format as mentioned, and Katharine Chin is a beautiful narrator. She does justice to the Chinese in the book while making the story more than the sum of its parts, the trademark of whether or not a book serves well as an audiobook for me. You feel painful passages, you’re touched at the inspiring ones. I ended the book crying at work, so, good job to Katharine.\\n\\nThe book is realistic and gritty, following Lin Daiyu through being trafficked to the United States, forced to work in a brothel, and her subsequent escape and struggle to survive, to try to make it back to China. Her personal struggles are shadowed by sexual violence and the ongoing threat of sexual assault for much of the book, as well as the specter of the Chinese exclusion act and increasing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence. The book feels so eerily timely to publish when and where we are now in America. History often feels like a wheel, and the worst kind of wheel.\\n\\nI will say that enjoyment of a book should play into a rating, not just the craft, research and content. For that I will mark this overall four stars, because it is very sad, and there is minimal emotional payoff for any optimistic readers. But it is also inspiring and educational, the research and emotional investment I was coerced into are very effective and the book deserves high marks. The author’s note is well worth listening to or reading, by the way.',\n",

I'm not going to explain the story, as so many other reviewers do, you can read the description given by Goodreads. What I am going to do is say that this book is a must-read.

       " 'It’s often interesting to see what motivated an author to craft a particular story. Especially when the push to create something powerful comes from empathy for the powerless. Like Sabaa Tahir who says her own experience of growing up as a kid who didn’t fit in and then reading about various stories of some absolutely voiceless people when she worked as a copy editor for Washington Post’s international desk, inspired her to finally write An Ember in the Ashes. So it’s no surprise to find —through the book’s author note— that Jenny Tinghui Zhang’s came into existence after her father requested her to write a story based on what he had come across: a marker, while visiting a site in Idaho, referencing to an incident of 1885 when five Chinese people were hanged by vigilantes.\\n\\nThe raw intention that must have fuelled Zhang when first drafting this novel is evident from a plot that doesn’t hold back on what can happen —must have happened and is still happening— to those who are destined to or want their stories to span two continents, two directions: the East and the West. It’s a historical fiction that draws on the infamous Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that was founded on anti-Asian sentiments in America. But there’s a sense of urgency in this fiction that reads real and the historical context that unfortunately holds true even in present times.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I am kidnapped, it does not happen in an alleyway. It does not happen in the middle of the night. It does not happen when I am alone.” From the very first line, Zhang warns you that the story isn’t one you would expect, especially if you wish for it to abide by what you must have already read with respect to the plot’s events. Daiyu, a thirteen-year-old girl, was born in a Chinese village where she had a place and its people to call home: her grandmother taught her patience while learning to care for the living things in her garden; her mother taught her how to be good with hands while she made tapestries; and her smart father taught her to work with her mind. But this family also gave her the name of a tragic heroine. From the story of , one of China’s four great classic novels, Lin Daiyu is a poet who fell in love with a boy above her in the pyramid of social hierarchy. When the boy’s family disapproves of the match and disguises another girl as their son’s one true love on his wedding day, Lin Daiyu falls terribly ill and dies.\\n\\nDaiyu frequently wonders throughout the story if she would succumb to the misfortune of the character she is named after, and constantly tries to run away from the destiny attached to this name. Every adversity in her life is blamed on the fate her name holds. Like the first domino falling, her parents disappear and her grandmother warns her that the same people who captured her parents would come for her too —urging her to run away to the city.\\n\\nThe city teaches her she can’t be a girl anymore if she wishes to survive. So with a jacket and shaved head, she becomes Feng. Sweeping steps outside the calligraphy school, she discovers her interest in the art form and the father-like Master Wang teaches her how to write. Zhang’s research shines through these pages of momentary happiness in our protagonist’s life as a lyrical meditation on the language and its beautiful strokes can be witnessed. The idea of how one’s first language shapes them is unmissable.\\n\\nAnother domino subsequently falls when Daiyu is kidnapped at the fish market by a dangerous Chinese gang. A year locked in a dark room, forced to learn English, Daiyu traces Chinese characters with her fingers in hope for familiarity, home, and roots —recounting the significance of each stroke in a character. Shipped to America to be sold to a brothel, Daiyu’s destiny is once again indisputable and devastating. It is here that the ‘timely’ historical fiction interspersed with Chinese mythology makes space for magical realism when Daiyu’s namesake appears as a ghost. The spirit acts as a materialisation of what our heroine believed was her, of what she believed was now only hers to suffer through: the cruel fate married to this name. The teenage Daiyu’s trauma finds a release in the times she summons the ghost.\\n\\nThe United States teaches Daiyu that here, she doesn’t need to disguise herself as a boy to be safe, because it is just as dangerous for Chinese men as it is for Chinese women. But that bit of her identity isn’t changeable; it can’t be taken off like a jacket. She realises the injustices are different on this other side of the world but aren’t any less brutal. Like the very many starts to Daiyu’s story— the author subtly begins a lot of sections with the phrase, “This is the story of…” —through the course of this journey, another blank page is drawn to start over when she escapes to Idaho. In this mining town, she creates a new life disguised as a man.\\n\\nisn’t easy to read but it’s easy to comprehend as one meant to be difficult. It explores the exploitation, fetishization, segregation, and blatant racism faced by the Chinese in a land they come to with hope or are dragged to with abuse. At the core of it all, this debut is dark and tragic. It’s not one you can escape through. It’s one your emotions will force you to hold on to as Zhang’s poetic prose unravels a story of reclamation—even though there’s no justice, no closure, no happiness at the end. Though, there is a reminder and an encouragement throughout.',\n",

With that background, the novel touches on kidnapping, sexual slavery, sexual assault, the loss of family, hiding identities, found family, and racism on all ends of the spectrum. But the characters fall flat in Four Treasures, and they are not great vehicles for conveying so many stories and emotions. The pacing wasn’t great, some parts would be so detailed only to be rushed at the end. I was left wanting more but also waiting for it to end.

Babel is the world's center of translation and, more importantly, of silver-working: the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation through enchanted silver bars to magical effect. Silver-working has made the British Empire unparalleled in power, and Babel's research in foreign languages serves the Empire's quest to colonize everything it encounters. Oxford, the city of dreaming spires, feels like a fairytale for Robin. It is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, and knowledge means power. But for Robin, a Chinese boy raised in Britain, this means inevitably betraying his motherland. Robin has to decide whether he should continue to pursue knowledge and stay in Babel, or will he choose to side with the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to sabotaging the silver-working, which in essence, defies Babel.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe passage above speaks the truth. For those of you who don't know, Indonesia is my first language, Chinese (Mandarin) is my second, and English is my third language. Due to my lack of usage of the Chinese language, it honestly felt like English has transformed into my second language. As you can probably guess from the title and premise of , colonialism, racism, languages, translations, identities, necessities of violence, and finding a place to belong are some of the heaviest themes of . Regardless of whether you love or more, I am filled with confidence in saying that Kuang has outdone herself with this novel.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a LOT to unpack in this standalone novel. Each of the themes I mentioned earlier was discussed with ruthless exploration. And I believe that any reader reading could actually use the novel to write their own dissertation on one—or more—of the chosen themes. It felt crystal clear that Kuang has done a myriad of research, and she put them all on the pages of . As a reader who speaks multiple languages, I've been reading, writing, thinking, or speaking in two or three languages every day. It won't come as a surprise that I have an interest in linguistics, etymology, and translation. And has them all. Done in a meticulous and addictive fashion, taking place in an alternative historical fantasy setting, never cease to raise thought-provoking questions and discuss important issues with its readers.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat if the city of dreaming spires is, in reality, a tower leading them to an inevitable nightmare through the illusion of grandeur and greatness? is not as grim as . It also has a comparatively more likable main character, which I'll get into soon. And these elements made the events and development in more relatable. Look, I could talk about the plot all day long if I want to. But it is quite frankly impossible to discuss in more detail what made the themes executed in so cleverly done without going into spoiler territory. The book isn't out yet for more than two months, and I prefer leaving the best of the plot in to future readers to find out for themselves. Instead, I will now proceed to elaborate upon the characters of and their characterizations.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most magnificent things about is its characterizations, especially for Robin Swift. In one book, less than 700 pages long, Kuang managed to meticulously introduce and develop Robin Swift. His character development and story arc felt immense. Seriously, by the end of the novel, try to look back to the beginning of the novel, and you will see how far Robin Swift has changed. Plus, his character development never felt forced. His grief, rage, dilemma, struggles, kindness, and relatively brief moments of happiness felt so genuine. And I, several times throughout the novel, truly empathized with him. The numbers of challenges, jealousy, avarice, manipulation, and domination he has to defeat were just staggering.\\n\\n\\n\\nFortunately, Robin was not alone in facing the cruelties pushed upon him. Accompanying him were three supporting characters: Ramy, Letty, and Victoire. This group of friends, these four characters, are individuals with distinct and different personalities, and yet circumstances allowed them to eagerly trust one another without any interrogations. Will they live happily ever after? Well, that's for you to find out. But do know this is a novel by R.F. Kuang, and it is not a spoiler to say Kuang is going to put her characters through physically and mentally crushing pain. As the characters wait for dawn to visit them after a night of explosive discord and conflicts, I waited with bated breath with them. I was so invested in the characters, especially Robin and Victoire, and I consider it a testament to how well-written this book was that, among many other factors, ALL characters in this standalone novel felt so distinctive and compelling.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also a feeling of satisfaction in reading Kuang's novels from her debut in publication order. Kuang is an author that keeps getting better and better with each new book, and is the author at the top of her game. The narrative has the potential to strike a various range of emotions, and it is delivered mercilessly. One out of many examples, and I'm going to be vague about this, there was a virtuous character who has their kindness tested too far, and we readers get to witness how deadly the malice that kindness can conjure from this. I felt distraught and conflicted by this, in a good way. But at the same time, I also felt sad, and to a level, rewarded by the turn of events. The prose continuously flows well, and the author successfully nailed the character's development. This doesn't mean I fully agree with the character's actions and motivation, but I understood them. The devastations wrought to counter colonialism portrayed were bloody and vicious, and I found the narrative hard to put down. asks its readers whether there is indeed morality and necessity in violence, or is it all an unnecessary and endless deadly cycle with no way out.\\n\\n\\n\\nLastly, I need to mention that I have never been to Oxford or United Kingdom. In fact, I have never been outside of Asia. It remains one of my goals to visit the UK and other countries outside Asia. This is to say that did not only immerse me in its memorable story, but it made me want to visit London even more. It's such a vividly portrayed novel with incredible world-building and layered histories. Yes, takes place in our world, but adding the magic of silver-making that required memories and the proficiency in languages and translations to the narrative provided a totally brilliant result in enriching the depth and complexities of the world. I seem to now have a newfound extra appreciation for translators, too. Take a look at this passage:\\n\\n\\n\\nIsn't that so accurate and profound? I actually highlighted more passages in compared to the entire . is one of the finest standalone novels I've read. It is a victory for literature, and its quality is what every other dark academia novel should strive to be. Paying homage to the importance of languages, translations, identity, and ethnicities, is one of the most important works of the year. August 2022 will be a big month for the fantasy genre. Not only is the third novel of the year so far that I rated with a full 5 out of 5 stars rating, but it will also be released in August 2022, just a week after by R.R. Virdi, which was the second novel I rated 5 out 5 stars rating this year. With and as her bibliography so far, I feel assured already in declaring R.F. Kuang as one of my favorite authors of all time. A marvelous one-off fantasy standalone is frequently difficult to find. Pre-order . You won't regret it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere do stand in my best books of the year list? To that, I’ll say:\",\n",
       " 'let\\'s lead with the good: this is very polished and eminently readable, and it is no small feat to make a book that\\'s at least 30% lectures about etymology into digestible commercial fiction. it ticks along like a well-oiled engine, it is a thick book where i would plow through pages by the hundred at a time, and the research that holds it up is visibly thorough, particularly where it intersects with rf kuang\\'s own areas of study. the lectures about etymology are vibrantly, engagingly delivered, as if by the brightest youngest professor in your school; in later sections when she has to describe the conditions of warfare and siege are polished and confident as well, as this is a research-based comfort zone for the author and has been so since the poppy war series.\\n\\nrf kuang has 2 masters degrees, oxford and cambridge, and is currently doing a phd at yale. it is necessary that i lead with this; she has made it necessary and with this book in particular she wants me to talk about it. the research that scaffolds her books is her own academic work, which is something that has tremendously impressed her readership in the past. indeed, it\\'s very clear that she digs deep into her research and based on the places in this book that are *just* research i am certain that her academic work is engaging, rigorous, and vibrant. however, i am currently reading her alleged work of fantasy literature, and while i could certainly believe she is a brilliant academic, that is not precisely the same skillset. all of my issues with the book come down to the same source: i do not believe that kuang has pushed herself to learn beyond the scope of her own research, or to ballast her skillset as a novelist outside of it.\\n\\nthis would have been perfectly functional historical fiction but if you consider it a fantasy it is a failure - while its factual reproduction of imperial british history is, fine, it has essentially neglected to build a new world for itself in any meaningful way. if the copy seems unclear about how this speculative alternative history where imperial britain runs on magic is materially changed by the fact of that magic, the answer is: it is not. this is not being glib or rude. british-empire-plus-magic is unchanged from what you know of history; the history of the industrial revolution is meticulously recreated on-page, inserting \\'silver\\' before \\'industrial\\', but having researched what actually happened, the author seems extraordinarily timid about changing the shape of that world. the lack of inventiveness with how - not just The Empire but the people that make it up would react to having real magic at their disposal!! - is not just lazy but distracting. the excess of exact plausibility came around to breaking my suspension of disbelief from the other side. there\\'s a footnote where she mentions one of william blake\\'s poems (\"dark satanic mills\") and if you do that it begs the question - do you think william blake would have written the same library of poetry word for word in a world where there is, again, real magic? look at blake\\'s paintings, look me in the eye, and tell me that again. there is no joy and no curiosity about how she builds a world allegedly divergent from our own and no creativity about the ripple effects of magic and its potential uses beyond kuang\\'s own (again, itself very enchanting) passion for translated words. in the end, the function of the magic is exclusively to provide convenient on-off switch so she can deliver a fantasy of \\'what if we could simply turn off the engines of empire?\\' and while that\\'s a soothing vision in late capitalism it feels not just shallow but unsatisfying, because if history as we know it is utterly unchanged by the addition of \\'silver\\' then it\\'s hard to believe that its removal will have any enduring effects. like oh no, samuel crompton invented the spinning mule with magic in your world? i guess when magic is gone he\\'ll have to (checks notes) invent it, unmagically, the exact same way?\\n\\nbut kuang manages expectations of creativity from the front: her author\\'s note is an extended, rather defensive description of the tower she has invented on oxford campus, and an assertion of her right to do this, argued against an imaginary guy who is i guess furious that she dared to invent anything for her fiction novel. this guy never leaves her behind, and she comes off like she does not either think that she should be inventing inside the records of history or that she is allowed to - which is a bizarre stance to take for an author whose book is entirely about how these halls are not in fact hallowed and should be reclaimed. but then again, she also leads by telling us that she kept the oyster tower from her own oxford ball because she found it such an impressive and dramatic tableau of Luxury despite the fact that oysters were peasant food in victorian england. does she invent a magical way to preserve the oysters, or make any small note about this distinction in the scene? no, they\\'re just there because they were there for her in real life and she cannot or will not imagine an equivalently excessive feast in victorian london that would shock her characters speechless in the same way. not \\'i have to convey awe-inspiring wasteful luxury\\' - \\'they have to have oysters because i have oysters\\'.\\n\\nthat same creative ethic (or lack thereof) - \\'it must be exactly as i know it, otherwise the readers Will Not Understand\\' - is also a glaring issue with its political language. the cast of characters is an ethnically diverse cohort in imperial british oxford, and their descriptions and the way they talk about their identity in imperial britain is pulled directly from 2020s twitter. this is both tonally distracting (when a student of imperial british oxford refers to the \\'narco-military state\\'), extremely patronizing (when a student of imperial british oxford says derisively of a character we\\'re supposed to dislike \\'she\\'s not helping the feminist cause\\'), and occasionally sets foot into a bear trap (when a nonwhite student of imperial british oxford calls another nonwhite student of victorian oxford a \\'brown man\\', from a position of racial solidarity - they absolutely did not have that as an umbrella solidarity term at the time but they SURE DID have it in victorian race science! if i was writing a book about a mixed cohort in imperial british oxford i feel like the first thing i would do is a basic google of how people were talking about race at the time to see what i wanted to use and what i wanted to meticulously discard - and to say nothing of kuang\\'s live jstor account, she has the same google!).\\n\\nthis is to me an absolutely insane blind spot for a book literally about language\\'s nuance and inadequacies! how are you going to \\'translate\\' all of your ideological terms into 2022ese uncritically, and be like \\'obviously this is the only ethical language\\', IN THIS BOOK, ON THIS SUBJECT? more than just patronizing the modern reader*, the ultra-contemporary political language felt demeaning of the historical record: there are plentiful accounts of what it was like to experience racism, imperialism, oppression under the colonial british rule, told in (i say this deliberately) the recorders\\' own voices. the inhabitants of those experiences had the language to express themselves, and to pursue liberation. the authorial unwillingness to write in any kind of historical voice implies that antiracist/decolonial thinking is a modern invention that cannot exist without our modern vocabulary, and i can\\'t think of any stance more dismissive or insulting to the history that in fact delivered us to the present. our words too will expire and prove inadequate, in time.\\n\\n*in case you, dear reader, do not get the point, there are regular footnotes** when a character experiences the racism of imperial british policy or literature that say \\'jsyk, this is racist\\'. the instances of racism in imperial british policy or literature are - not subtle. i feel like if you are worried about depiction being mistaken for endorsement in your novel about multiethnic citizens of the imperial british empire, you need to table the novel.\\n**but of course, the footnotes have to exist to put the book into conversation*** with jonathan strange and mr norrell!\\n***the book is not in conversation with jonathan strange and mr norrell. jonathan strange and mr norrell is exuberantly concerned with answering the question \\'what if england had magic\\' and weaving the tapestry of the alternate history that question presents, and as mentioned that question could not be further beneath rf kuang\\'s interest. this is a thematic and tonal response to harry potter, and it\\'s a decent one at that - from \\'what if there was a reason all spells were delivered in garbled latin\\' to \\'well sure britain runs on wizards but obviously that doesn\\'t change anything you know about it\\' to the kuang commissioned. but i understand why they couldn\\'t put that in the copy.',\n",

And, for a minute, the world seemed so still, like the last few pages were a clip from a silent film. I’m writing this review immediately after finishing the book.

Kuang’s writing can be very technical, and often reads like a textbook. Despite the dense, lecture-like paragraphs about etymology and the history of language, is incredibly immersive. It’s so easy to get swept up in this story. Over the 24 hours that I was reading this, I would tell myself that I was just sitting down to read a few pages, only to accidentally read one hundred.\\n\\nI enjoy reading nonfiction and I have a passion for languages, so when I closed the cover of the book feeling like I had just completed a university course, I was filled with this sort of humming glee. I can see myself reading again and again, poring over every sentence with the same fascination that I experienced this first time through.\\n\\nRebecca Roanhorse calls Kuang’s love-hate letter to academia, which could not be more accurate. Nowhere else have I read academia described with so much biting, loving, unflinching detail.\\n\\n\\nhonors the magic of translation and linguistics. While many say that words are just sequences of sounds given meaning, language is undeniably a keystone of history and culture. Translation is a highly underappreciated art. Every time words are converted between languages, they lose some of their association, some of their meaning and gravity. What is most important in a translation? The author’s style and voice? The emotional message? The exact words themselves?\\n\\n\\nRobin, the main character, feels so real. For most of the book, he grapples with impossible decisions. He was taken to Babel without choice, but he feels at home in the tower, which feeds his hunger for knowledge. He knows that the research he works on supports British imperialism, but he relishes the power he wields as a translator and silver-worker. As he witnesses Britain pump opium into China, his homeland, he struggles to choose between the utopian life of comfort and discovery he has grown to treasure and everything he has wilfully ignored for most of his life: the fact that he will never truly be accepted in Oxford for who he really is, that to the empire, people like him are either curiosities to be examined or subhumans to be exploited. Staying at Babel feels like a betrayal, but the enormity of the other option frightens him: join the secretive Hermes Society to take a stand against Britain’s abuse.\\n\\nThis is where many of the most weighty questions are raised. As the title suggests, Babel is in part a breakdown of the necessity of violence. It’s easy to say that nothing is solved by brute force that could not have been solved by diplomacy, but will an oppressor ever be able to sacrifice their pride and greed? At what point does a line need to be crossed, a transition from peaceful activism to the threat or action of violent upheaval?\\n\\n\\nRobin, Ramy, Victoire, and Letty are all meticulously drawn characters. While their bond is fiery and passionate, they are afraid to test the limits of their inherent differences. Letty, raised in an upper-class white family, has trouble understanding how Robin, Ramy, and Victoire will never truly be free at Babel. How they were taken from their countries and shackled to Babel, forced to help construct the same empire that is destroying their homes and enslaving their people.\\n\\n\\nis passionate, scathing, incendiary, fervent. It has all the inevitability and gravity of a tidal wave, a massive force crashing into me, sweeping me away.

       " \"I tried my very hardest to like this. I thought The Poppy War was excellent when I read it a few years ago, and Babel seemed like a combination of subjects I find fascinating and spent my own uni days immersed in-- history, language/linguistics, colonial studies --but in hindsight, I wonder if I might have found it better if I knew nothing about those subjects.\\n\\nis set in Britain in the first half of the 1800s. A young Chinese boy is brought from Canton to London by a language professor and taught Latin, Greek and Chinese in preparation for his future studies at Babel-- Oxford University's Institute of Translation. In this alternate world enchanted silver is used to power the empire, and it is the careful application of language that enables silver's power to be harnessed. In short, it is about how colonial powers used language to control and profit from others.\\n\\nI almost gave up after the first 200 pages, but my partner had already read and liked the book so he convinced me to continue.\\n\\nMy initial impression (true of the whole book, it turned out) was that it said an awful lot, repeated an awful lot, and still managed to be very basic in its examination of its themes and characters. The language/linguistics analysis is an overview of any beginner linguistics course. Anyone familiar with a rudimentary history of how languages have been shaped and changed over time will not find anything new here. Perhaps it will be more interesting to those who are unfamiliar with these subjects.\\n\\nTo me, it felt very much like reading a textbook. Dry regurgitation of a linguistics or postcolonial lecture. The author uses Oxford as a setting and the later Industrial Revolution as a historical template, adding very little that was new to any of it. The protagonist, Robin, is a very passive unmemorable character, surrounded by characters who are either equally benign and forgettable, often serving as mouthpieces for what feel like jarringly modern views, or else one-dimensional EVIL imperialist racists.

Why are all the characters lacking in nuance?\\n\\nEach one of the footnotes spread throughout seems to exist to hammer the points over our head.\\n\\nSomehow, I finished it.

Sometimes the footnotes are used appropriately, e.g., to provide historical or linguistic context, but too often she uses footnotes as a crutch to explain her characters\\' inner thoughts, which should be apparent from the main text.\\n\\nR.F.

RF Kuang’s prose remains as gripping as ever, even as she slowly builds tension and layers on nerdy academic teachings. I have always been interested in the dark academia genre but have yet to read many of the staples—but I feel completely satisfied with Babel. What else do I need when I have a book about the horrors of academia within the colonial empire, tackling the balance of life or death not just with the acts of individuals but those of an entire system?\\n\\nSpecifically, , a discipline by which I’ve always been fascinated. Especially after taking a linguistics course this semester (and recognizing so many things in the book that we covered in class!), I nerded out even more over the linguistic nuggets Kuang sprinkled throughout the pages. Kuang’s passion for linguistics and translation is so evident with each lecture and conversation, and it made me connect even more to the book. The magic system is genius: Languages will always come into contact with one another, but basing the magic system on how languages retain their diversity despite that contact sends such a powerful message. However, I would say that Babel is mainly historical fiction, using the magic system more as a vessel for the ideas Kuang wants to discuss rather than something that can stand independently. (In fact, the magic feels a bit out of place, only relevant for its connections to these themes.)\\n\\nMainly, though, Babel is about . Robin questions how he should live, whether he should focus on his own survival while at the heart of the colonial empire or resist. Both come at a personal cost: the weight of denial or the risk of his life. Kuang takes the reader along Robin’s realistic journey of realizing the necessity of resistance and violence to achieve decolonization. This book is most heartbreaking not in the parts related to death, but in the parts about hoping and hoping to one day belong and be valued in a place that does not see him as human—and the realization that it never will. Like with the Poppy War trilogy (and in my opinion, even more than TPW), I do think Kuang gets caught up with painting large thematic statements and subsequently leaves behind the characters. But I enjoy Kuang’s writing specifically for her themes, so I can’t exactly complain.\\n\\nThe biggest flaw of Babel for me is that the messages are not subtle. This is shaping up to be a trend in Kuang’s works, and while I don’t necessarily it, I don’t quite love it either. While I enjoyed some of the footnotes that gave us extra tidbits of historical information, others grated on me with their haughty “this is racist by the way, in case you didn’t know” remarks about things that were… obviously racist. I love all of the themes that Kuang so expertly explores, but I am smart enough to figure out for myself how x represents a symbol of oppression or x reveals an imperialist mindset—and I don’t need it repeated throughout the book either. Kuang is brilliant, certainly, and I think her commentary on and critique of whiteness and colonialism is, too. I just a little more.\\n\\nBut… I guess I can’t really say that, because despite how too on-the-nose I thought Kuang’s messages to be, white people still manage to miss the memo! I sincerely hope that all the Lettys out there will read Babel and emerge a changed person, but I doubt it. So while it is not for me (someone who can read properly), the constant hammering on the head is clearly necessary for other people, and I can appreciate it for that function.\\n\\nIf, like me, you find yourself slightly peeved when authors lack trust in their readers, then Babel might grate on you at times. But it was not enough to make me dislike this book, because there truly are so many things to take away from Babel. This is real dark academia: true sinister atrocities brought to light and a bold questioning of what it means to make a change. After The Poppy War trilogy, I suspected that Kuang would forever remain a . Babel cements that belief. She has the skill to make me forgive shortcomings that would normally ruin a book for me.\\n\\n—★—',\n",
       " 'The Italian word for disappointment is delusione, from the Latin de-ludus, literally “to make fun of”. Its closest cognate in the English language is delusion, which the Oxford Dictionary defines as “an idiosyncratic belief or impression maintained despite being contradicted by reality”.\\n\\nR. F. Kuang has me stuck in a never-ending cycle of delusion and disappointment. I keep convincing myself that I’m going to love her next book, and she makes fun of me by delivering something that doesn’t remotely match my expectations. Then she publishes a new book, and the cycle repeats.\\n\\n, in particular, seemed like the kind of novel I’ve been wanting to read for years. As a former translator, I was excited to learn more about its language-based magic system. As a reader, I’ve grown increasingly tired with the romanticization of academia and the classism inherent in the dark academia genre. And as someone whose family was deeply affected by European imperialism, I am keenly interested in fiction that discusses this topic.\\n\\nThe premise, then, was stellar; the execution, not so much.\\n\\nMy first issue was . To create an organic fantasy world, an author should either pick their setting based on how they want magic to work, or pick their magic system based on what makes sense for the setting. Instead, Kuang picked her setting (Victorian England) and her magic system (words translated on silver bars) based on the themes she wanted to tackle, with no apparent consideration for the actual compatibility of the two in real life. The result is a world that looks and works exactly like the real British Empire, even though its magic has nothing to do with the technology the British used.\\n\\n. Historically, the reason Britain invented and developed the technology that led to the Industrial Revolution was that this technology required huge investments, made possible by the exploitation of the colonies. But translating words and engraving them on silver bars doesn’t require any sort of advanced technology.\\n\\nBesides the cost of silver, which we’re told is abundant in the colonies, there are no reasons why any advanced civilization couldn’t develop their own institute of translation. The idea that translation alone is responsible for the technological superiority of the British Empire is ludicrous. Frankly, the only reason someone would come up with that idea is that they idolize translation to a point where they think it could actually be the single most important form of knowledge in human history.\\nWhich, considering that Kuang is herself a translator, doesn’t seem like a far-fetched idea.\\n\\nThis single-minded obsession with the novel’s themes is also reflected in its characters. All of them are written not as multi-faceted humans, but as spokespeople for a certain perspective the author wants to portray. Robin is a British-Chinese man torn between his two identities; Rami is an anti-colonial activist who hates the Empire; Lettie is a privileged white woman; every British man is a cruel, evil imperialist devoid of humanity.\\n\\n\\nAnd listen, I can appreciate a good allegory. But these characters aren’t even deep or original stand-ins for the concepts they’re meant to represent. All their political discussions seem to have been taken straight out of Twitter. If you’re on social media and even tangentially interested in postcolonial discourse, I guarantee you’ve heard it all before. Throughout the book I kept wondering, what is it that Kuang is trying to say with these didactic, on-the-nose explanations? That the British Empire was racist? That colonialism is bad? That workers were exploited during the Industrial Revolution? But you don’t need to convince your 21st century readers of this. And those who may still need convincing (bigots) will certainly not be swayed by a book that depicts all English people as evil, chauvinistic imperialists.\\n\\nInstead, the author constantly interjects the narration with footnotes that are meant to clarify what is already obvious to anyone with minimal reading comprehension skills. These notes tell us that the racist things racist characters say are, in fact, racist; that Britain’s wealth comes from it being an exploitative colonial empire; that astrology doesn’t actually work; and other things that no human being with a functioning brain would possibly need explaining. These notes are also extradiegetic, meaning that they’re external to the narration: it’s not a fictional character writing them, but the author herself, who is directly addressing her modern readers. This felt very condescending and took me out of the story, causing me to wonder who Kuang thinks she’s writing for, if she envisions her ideal reader as someone who needs to have everything over-explained to them.\\n\\nUntil it dawned on me that so much of this book wasn’t written for me, or any other human reader. It was written for Twitter—specifically, an imaginary Twitter user who only exists in Kuang’s head, and whose entire existence revolves around levelling petty, bad faith criticism at her writing. This user gets really riled up about her making up a new building to house the Oxford Institute of Translation, in her fantasy novel about a made up Oxford Institute of Translation. They complain about her obviously racist villains not being condemned enough by the narrative. They get upset about a revolutionary character killing an innocent girl, in a book that is literally titled .\\n\\nProblem is, you can’t write a book for someone like that. First of all, because this person is not real: they’re a mental image conjured by the author’s own anxieties and insecurities. Secondly, because no good art has even come out of a need to pre-emptively defend oneself from baseless accusations. And thirdly, because despite Kuang’s best efforts, it’s impossible to make criticism-proof art.\\n\\nI understand that it can be difficult to shut down the bad faith reader inside your head. Still, authors need to stop writing to convince an imaginary person that they’re morally righteous, and start treating their readers like intelligent adults who can figure things out on their own.\\n\\nBecause there is a good story buried in here. If you take away the repetitive, superfluous explanations that bog down the narrative; if you add some complexity and nuance to the characters’ personality; if you give the audience a chance to think for themselves instead of lecturing them; you get an interesting novel that attempts to deconstruct the dark academia genre through the lens of language and translation. And this potential is particularly evident in the last 10% of the book, which ended up adding a star to my final rating. , imbued with a raw sincerity the rest of the novel lacks. I just wish it didn’t take me so long to get there.',\n",
       " 'Now a Goodreads Choice finalist in Fantasy!!\\n\\nI have put off writing this review for months, for no reason other than I was afraid of failing to fully and accurately explain R.F. Kuang’s newest work to people interested in reading it. So I hope you’ll forgive me for letting myself off the hook in a way—I’m not going to be covering the entirety of Babel in this single Goodreads review. As more people read their advance copies, I’m sure there’ll be a surplus of opinions to take into consideration before beginning this book, but I’m not going to attempt to take Rebecca’s place in telling this story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first thing that I think potential readers should keep in mind is that this isn’t the kind of book you’d typically build a fandom around. It’s not a fantasy of dragons and swords, fairies and secret doors, but a tale of the monsters who built the world we all currently inhabit. It is a fantasy so deeply rooted in history and imperialism that it almost feels like it could have actually happened this way. So as much as we’ve all enjoyed the character art and mockups of beautiful special editions being passed around online, I just want to make sure everyone’s expectations are where they should be. If you’re here for ships and tropes that will go viral on TikTok and Instagram, you may end up disappointed.\\n\\nIf it wasn’t obvious from full title, , you’re going to get a healthy helping of both the ‘Dark’ and ‘Academia’ portions of the genre. I’d also like to emphasize that Kuang goes well beyond an academic aesthetic setting, fully entrenching every aspect of the story deep within the bowels of academia. We get to see students rigorously study their specialized fields, but also the unsavory sides of this culture typically hidden from public view. The magic system is no exception to this rule, relying fundamentally on language, and specifically the act of translation. Lovers of literature, historians and linguists, both professionals and enthusiasts, will adore this aspect. It’s not a flashy kind of magic and deceptively simple in concept, which is why it lends so easily into an alternate history novel. The way it’s incorporated feels plausible, and the who and why this power is being sought, all too probable.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough our core four characters—Robin, Victoire, Ramiz, and Letitia—we bear witness to the day-to-day lives of institutional outsiders as they try to navigate a system inherently hostile to their presence but desperately in need of their skills and labor. There’s some obvious similarities between the author and the main character, Robin, but all four of them carry pieces of that misfit quality that will ring true for so many. What she ends up doing with each character separately and as a group is very clever, probing their blind spots and privileges in ways that will challenge the readers’ own complicities. Their interactions are at times encouraging, sometimes devastating, but always ring true. Fair warning, though, there will be moments that feel so honest that they’re likely to sting.\\n\\nI think the underlying emotion guiding the text is a steadily building rage. The number of quiet cruelties that the marginalized characters must absorb then set aside would be enough to drive most from pursuing this kind of educational tract, which is by design. In fact, if you’re reading and you’re not angry, you’re doing it wrong. On the domestic political side, there’s a thoughtful examination of the labor movement of that era, interlaced with not-so-subtle remarks on the exploitive nature of capitalism. You can draw a number of parallels between the UK of this time period and the US currently, a comparison probably not lost on a Chinese American writer studying in England.\\n\\nWhat’s clear is that Rebecca’s time at Cambridge, Oxford, and later Yale greatly informed both her writing and perspective on the state of the world, particularly how it came to be this way. The result is a scathing indictment of British and European colonialism, including the rippling effects across continents; and it’s entirely deserved. Magic in this world is just another resource to be extracted from the poor by the powerful, and when those wells run dry they do what their real life counterparts did—embark to find and exploit other lands and people. But no amount of blood spent will ever be enough to satisfy their incessant thirst for more.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’ve read Kuang’s previous Poppy War trilogy, you know what tone to expect. You cannot build a sustainable legacy on the broken backs of your fellow man. There’s no great twist of fate to save the day, just the relentless resistance of those who reach that breaking point. This is not a feel-good story, despite being an exceptional one. It’s a classic R.F. Kuang slow-march of inevitability—and absolutely perfect. Prepare yourself for brilliance. Prepare yourself for heartbreak. Prepare yourself for the triumph of .',\n",

       " 'Earlier this year, I came up with my dream author panel: RF Kuang, Patrick Rothfuss, Neil Gaiman, and Philip Pullman. When thinking through this, I wanted to know if anyone has ever had a fantasy author panel before, and I discovered that, indeed, Comic-Con has had fantasy author panels in the past.\\n\\nBecause I have learned that the worst people can say is no, I contacted Comic-Con, asking if I could host this fantasy author panel. They said sure but would give me no budget, so it was a non-starter.\\n\\nHowever, my dreams never die. Eventually, I will either invite all of the authors to visit when I am properly book famous or I will team up with someone to do a Kickstarter.\\n\\nAll that to say, I really think that RF Kuang is the future of fantasy. The Poppy War is an incredible book that I simply loved, and I have mad respect for her.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first 5% and the last 40% were very strong. However, from about the 5% mark to the 60% mark need some revision.\\n\\nRecently, I have been reading Daemon Voices by Philip Pullman. It is a book about storytelling (which I highly, HIGHLY recommend). I’m going to paraphrase the gist of one of his thoughts, but Pullman is simply a master of writing. Authors or would-be authors need to practice the art of storytelling. Think of storytelling as a marketplace of sorts. Readers come into the marketplace with storytellers on every corner. Readers who are intrigued will linger, staying a few more minutes, but if they get bored, they will just pop on over to another corner to discover another storyteller.\\n\\nAlright so what does this have to do with Babel or am I just delusional? Well I’ll let you be the judge of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe storytelling needed improvement.\\n\\nFirst, way too much time was covered in this book. Even in Harry Potter, they only cover one year in each book. This book covers way too many years. It would have been better if RK Kuang just focused on the first year at Oxford or broke up Babel into several different books.\\n\\nSecond, this book is too far in the weeds about language and etymology, the origin and history of English words. Certain sections of Babel were so technical that they reminded me of my tax classes (but I found those much more interesting because literally the rules save you real money or keep you out of prison).\\n\\nThird, the story arc wasn’t clear until much, much later in the book. For a good portion of the time, I was like, “Um, where is this heading?”\\n\\nFourth, the ending is incredibly weak. Back to Pullman for a minute. In The Golden Compass, he has one of the best endings that I have ever read. I have never wanted to read the next book so badly. However, the ending in Babel is forgettable and lackluster.\\n\\nFifth, the sections on the characters need to be rewritten. The sections on Ramy, Victoire, and Letty were not as strong as they should have been. If I was editor of this book, I would have focused on one key moment in that character’s life and really focused on “showing, not telling”, really going through one moment which would move my readers’ very soul. Telling these characters’ life stories in one chapter is just too much to take in.\\n\\nSixth, I didn’t find Robin’s first day at Oxford very believable. Why would anyone risk everything without a safety net for a cause and a person that they only met 5 seconds ago?\\n\\nSeventh, there is one death that had too much foreshadowing. Dune is one of my favorite books, and one of the reasons is that a character was killed off that I never saw coming. In Babel, I would have been really surprised when this character was killed off, but I wasn’t surprised when we were warned right before it happened.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, the beginning is really strong and interesting.\\n\\nSecond, RF Kuang has a very good grasp of readability. For example, she doesn’t have massive paragraphs and massive sentences. She has also modernized the language for 1828. There are no thees or thous.\\n\\nThird, the fantasy is easy to understand and isn’t overwhelming.\\n\\nFourth, Babel addresses some important topics. Especially in today’s political climate, we have a choice: we can either work to change the system or we can refuse to engage. It really reminded me of all of the heat that Sheryl Sandberg received for writing Lean In, a book with tips about how women can succeed in the workforce. The criticism is that Sandberg offers how to succeed in the current atmosphere instead of advocating for changing the system. However, is it easier to change yourself or the entire system? That will be a question for your book club.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, this book did turn around at the end, but it took too long to get there. However, I’m not giving up on RF Kuang just yet. If anything, it just proves that I definitely need to put together this fantasy author panel.\\n\\n*Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion.',\n",

       " 'DNF at 60% but I skipped around until the end. Dark academia is hot right now, and Babel was supposed to be THE dark academia novel of the year. However, I absolutely despised Babel, and here\\'s why...\\n\\nRANT INCOMING:\\n\\nWhat a boring, mean-spirited book. It had little charm and came from a place of hate. And can this author write about anything other than one person starting a revolutionary war? Even her dark academia novel ends up going in the same direction as her Poppy War trilogy. Sis hasn\\'t gotten over her Hunger Games phase, it seems.\\n\\nThis book is SO dull. The only creative aspect was how the author managed to find different ways to say the same thing on every page: white people suck and they\\'re evil. By the billionth time, a white person came along to crap on the main characters or say something stupid, I was like, \\'Okay, we get it: whitey = evil.\\'\\n\\nAnd the footnotes were annoying and useless. They didn\\'t add anything to the story, and you could predict exactly what they were going to say before you even read them because 90% of them were just there to tear down every aspect of British history and culture. They\\'d pop in every now and then to tell you that some random thing was \\'problematic.\\' No shit, Sherlock. Everything from 200 years ago (Sherlock Holmes included) is problematic. That\\'s just history for you.\\n\\nThe characters:\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick note: I remember seeing this fan art when Kuang announced on Twitter that she was writing a dark academia novel a couple of years back. It got me so excited to read this book, and I\\'m really disappointed that I ended up not liking it.\\n\\nThese are some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters I\\'ve read about in a while.\\n\\nRobin - The author legit forgot to give Robin a personality. His defining trait was basically just noticing and reacting to racism.\\n\\nVictoire - She was a perfect human with a flawless personality, which made her annoying. If she ever got mad at someone, the story would bend over backward to make her point of view justified.\\n\\nRamy - Ramy\\'s defining trait was that he hates British people and their culture with every fiber of his being, but gets really upset when someone questions why he chose to study in Britain. The author was trying to do something with the hypocrisy of this, but because she was so hell-bent on portraying whites as evil and everyone else as good she missed the mark.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s Letty, the blonde-haired white girl...\\n\\n\\n\\nEveryone in her friend group: \\'Will this fcking btch ever shut up?\\'\\n\\nAlso...\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gang: Let\\'s keep it a secret.\\n\\nLetty: Hey... is this really the right thing to do?\\n\\nThe gang: I knew this btch was going to betray us at some point.\\n\\nLetty was the author\\'s favorite punching bag and outlet for all her hatred of white people. It was weird because Letty was created to be bullied and ostracized by the others. Was I supposed to enjoy this dynamic? There were scenes where the other three couldn\\'t wait for Letty to leave the room so they could talk freely among themselves. It took all of their efforts to tolerate Letty being in their presence.\\n\\nAt one point Robin says that he feels sorry for Letty and describes her as the innocent one in the group. I thought the author was giving her favorite chew toy a break. But actually, this whole section was about how Letty\\'s innocence came from her ignorance. She could never understand the others or truly experience things alongside them, and her attempts at caring and trying to connect with them were portrayed as annoying. When she grew impatient with their bad moods, it was supposed to be like a \\'gotcha\\' moment, a confirmation that she\\'s not one of them. Maybe this is a dig at white allies and the suggestion is that they\\'ll always benefit from white culture. Even if they think they\\'re being helpful, they\\'re still part of the problem and will always be. See what I mean about this book being mean-spirited? lol\\n\\nThe cherry on top of this crap sundae was Letty\\'s inevitable character arc. It turns out that Letty had a huge crush on Ramy, but Ramy could barely tolerate her presence. Because she couldn\\'t have him, her entitled, sociopathic white rage finally came out for everyone to see. She betrayed her friend group and got Ramy killed (I don\\'t know the full details because I was skipping around by this point). She destroyed him because she couldn\\'t get her way with him. Maybe Kuang\\'s message here is that the white woman\\'s true self will come out when she\\'s denied something because white culture teaches her that she can have anything she wants and minorities must fall in line with her will. Jesus... what a point of view lol. Then, to drive the point home, Victoire reflects back on her friendship with Letty and says that Letty was always a horrible, abusive person and now she finally sees it. Well I didn\\'t see it. In the beginning anyway, I mean, Letty was acting like a fairly normal person. Does that mean the author wanted us to read negatively into everything she did just because... she\\'s white?\\n\\nAll I wanted was for Kuang to present a more balanced view of humanity through the inclusion of Letty in the friend group. But nope lol! She thoroughly destroys any chance of that by making sure we know that all along Letty was a bad person, which means she was never really friends with them.\\n\\nAnother aspect of Letty that frustrated me was that the only sympathetic quality she was given was her minority status as a woman in college at that time. It was the only thing allowed to be good about her. So basically in the world of the book, if a character had a minority status they were allowed at least one point for sympathy. But unfortunately for Letty, being the whitest of whites gave her about minus 99 points automatically.\\n\\nIt was almost impressive how Kuang made sure that not a single white character is remotely likable. Even the cook, who was initially nice to Robin when he arrived in Britain, is later revealed to be a terrible person because she saw Robin getting beaten and didn\\'t do anything about it. So yeah, kudos to the author for her dogged determination to make sure no white gets away seeming likeable.\\n\\nThe Message:\\n\\nThe book\\'s message about the harmful effects of British colonization is important and worth discussing. It\\'s undeniable that the countries under British rule suffered greatly. But while I can understand Kuang\\'s strong feelings on the matter, I personally believe that British colonization is a complex issue that cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy of good or bad.\\n\\nI come from a culture that has been affected by British colonialism, too. My mother is from a small South Pacific island that was colonized by the British in the 1800s. The traditional customs of my mother\\'s culture were replaced with western ones, and the actions of the British at the time caused trauma that still affects my mother\\'s culture today. However, the reality is that if things had not happened as they did, I and many others would not be here now. We also might not have had the opportunities we have right now to create a positive future for ourselves and others.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s important to acknowledge historical injustices, dwelling on them and harboring resentment towards white people today is not right. The thing I don\\'t like about Babel is that there are very few gray areas (from what I read), it\\'s like 545 pages of encouraging the reader to see white people as one-dimensional caricatures, and embracing feelings of resentment and victimization and then feeling justified in these thoughts.\\n\\nI think this book might encourage POCs to adopt a victim mentality. When I was younger I bought into the idea that as a POC, I had been wronged in some way because of the past. But these beliefs aren\\'t even true and they also caused a lot of unnecessary insecurity and deppression. And I realized that there is no end to the blame game. I deeply regret wasting my energy on all of that. So I hate seeing my fellow POCs waste theirs by buying into victimhood and resentment when they could be doing things to actually bring themselves up. I understand that people are at different stages of healing, and I\\'m not saying that people should just shut up and be happy. I\\'m also not saying that my people\\'s relationship with British colonization is equal to other nations. All I know is that this book tries to make it okay to judge others based on their minority status, rather than on just being who they are. This is a terrible way to view others. Further, I believe the book promotes a victim mentality, which, from my experience, only harms mental health in the long run.\\n\\nAnyway so yeah, if you were to study at Oxford in the 1800s as a non-white international student, you would have been treated poorly by the locals. But even the book admits that at that time, Robin\\'s home country of Canton was rife with misogyny. Every nation was committing vile and foolish acts 200 years ago. For example, my people used to literally eat their enemies. The last time I visited my mother\\'s island, I purchased a history book about people being kidnapped and eaten by rival clans. This was not only for revenge, but it was also believed that the person consuming the victim would gain some of their powers. When the British arrived, they condemned cannibalism (and some of the missionaries were even speared and eaten as a result). The British may have butt in, but their decision to act as custodians over the islands set off a chain of events that led my mother\\'s people into the modern world.\\n\\nLast thoughts:\\n\\nEach to their own, but I find myself side-eying the white people who are so eager to give this book five stars. Perhaps they\\'re far less irritable than me or they enjoy masochism. Or maybe after reading 545 pages of white-people bashing, they\\'ve been worn down?\\n\\nAdditionally, many might be feeling like they need to be cautious when discussing the book because they know they\\'ll be attacked for expressing their true opinions on it. It doesn\\'t need to be said, you and I just know that calling out a minority\\'s resentment of white people is not the done thing and opens one up to being attacked.\\n\\nWe\\'ve just accepted that white people are now punching bags for minorities in order to make up for the past. And whites have accepted this role and are expected to endure it because they supposedly \"come from a place of privilege\". When a POC spews hatred over whites, they\\'re punching up, and therefore whites shouldn\\'t be offended.\\n\\nFirstly, that is not my idea of equality.\\n\\nSecondly, I understand that white people mean well when they say they come from a place of privilege, etc, but it\\'s cringey and minorities don\\'t need to be coddled like that. If anything, the fact that we are bending over backwards to avoid calling out a minority author for this type of bigotry does not imply that whites are the privileged ones, now does it? Kuang is free to write whatever she wants, but her mean-spirited approach in this book is ultimately destructive. At least for me, it completely destroys any interest I had in this book or any of her future works.\\n\\nSumming up:\\n\\nConsidering how popular this book is, it will likely encourage more people to buy into the blind hatred that leads to a lifetime of anger, suffering, and victimhood. That\\'s sad because I would rather see minorities breaking the cycle of our intergenerational trauma by living well and thriving. You can\\'t achieve that by being vengeful and expecting others to tolerate you, sorry.\\n\\nThis book was engaged in a mean-spiritedness that felt fundamentally gross to me. I call out gross shit when I see it, and if that makes me an uncultured swine, so be it\\n\\n*Edited on 1/09/23 to make my points a bit clearer*',\n",

I kept reading and waiting for the plot to go somewhere but ultimately it never did. But a lack of a plot doesn\\'t inherently mean a book is bad right? A lot of people don\\'t mind reading a \"no plot, just vibes\" book if the characters are compelling. So, are they compelling? Well...\\n\\nThe characters (and the world as a whole) just lacked any complexity or depth. I actually laughed when I saw a review that said has \"a brilliant presentation of the found family trope\". That\\'s completely wrong. These characters are not a found family. A found family indicates a level of trust, rapport, and devotion. Here, the characters keep things from each other, they never listen to one another, and every time we do see them talking to each other it always devolves into an argument.\\n\\nBut by far the biggest issue here was Letty. At no point did she feel like a real person. It was SO EVIDENT that she was just a mouthpiece for the author to get her beliefs across. She\\'s a woman which means she has some struggles in academia, but she\\'s white which means she avoids the struggles that non white women face (so you can tell that the author has heard of the word intersectionality). She uses her experiences with sexism to guilt trip others into accepting her demands but also isn\\'t aware of the privilege she has. The narrative CONSTANTLY tells us that she\\'s a racist and an ignoramus but it never actually shows her doing any of these things, which makes it extremely jarring when others accuse her of being bigoted, since there was no build up to it.\\n\\nThis is just the gist of the description and not an actual quote, but in one moment she would be described as \"someone who makes a few off hand comments here and there but ultimately a kind soul\" and then a hundred pages later Victoire and Ramy would be screaming at her about how she was unaware of their struggles with racism.\\n\\nShe was also just a weird character in general, at one point she discovers the others have been keeping a HUGE secret from her and I expected there to be some big blowout and argument... But instead she just doesn\\'t say anything and immediately forgives them. If I learned that my close friends we\\'re keeping such a secret from me, I would\\'ve said goodbye and broken all contact with them. On a pure narrative level, I can kinda understand Letty\\'s actions and beliefs but I ultimately can\\'t fully appreciate them because it was evident what the author was trying to do and I couldn\\'t read about her without feeling like R. F. Kuang was breathing down my neck.\\n\\nIn fact this is a big issue with all the characters in general, it felt like they were written around a single defining characteristic rather than being given space for something more. Here are all the characters summed up: Robin is the one who struggles with his biracial identity, Ramy is the one who hates the British, Victoire is the one who suffers so we can see the cruelty of colonialism, Letty is the one who\\'s a privileged white woman and Lovell is the one who\\'s a racist AND a hypocrite. They\\'re never given any dimension outside of this one attribute and it just starts to wear you down.\\n\\nWith regard to the world, there was, once again, a complete lack of any kind of nuance or complexity. Without (trying to) spoil much, there is a war about to happen between two countries and all the people in the aggressor country are portrayed as evil, heartless, and cruel, while all the people in the victim country are shown as innocent, virtuous, and pure. I\\'m not saying that all countries are heartless or all countries are good, what I\\'m saying is that such a simple dichotomy does not make for a rewarding reading experience. To elaborate:\\n\\nWhile I was reading , I was comparing it a lot to (which is the second book in The Aurelian Cycle Trilogy) by Rosaria Munda since both deal with themes of inequality, revolution, and war. And honestly if you want an example of these themes handled well go read instead (but obviously read Fireborne first lol). I\\'m just gonna say it here was just a less interesting and less compelling version of .\\n\\nLike in , there\\'s also a colonial empire antagonist in too, and it would have been so easy for the author to depict everyone under that regime as cruel and evil. But instead we actually see the day to day lives of ordinary people under that regime, how many people have different thoughts and beliefs and ideals and stakes. In addition we are also shown the lives of people under the \"innocent\" country and how the government and its people constantly make mistakes and errors and poor choices. This made for such a richer reading experience because we are shown the full stakes and complex actions of everyone involved, whereas in , there exists no such complexity. And yes, I know there were a few moments (in the end where everything was crammed in) where the characters began to question their actions, but that ultimately lead to nowhere.\\n\\nThe conclusive message of basically seems to be \"white people bad, everything sucks, and then you die\" (which is honestly most of literary fiction in general lmao) and that\\'s fine I guess. Despite all of my above criticisms I will agree that it\\'s a very smart book, and I know that every reader who picks it up will get something different out of it. I\\'m happy for them but alas, t\\'was not for me. I\\'m more than ready to read whatever epic fantasy Kuang comes out with next, but I think I\\'m gonna skip on her lit fic novels from now on.\\n\\nOh, and before I cast them out of my memory forever, fuck the footnotes.',\n",

It presents the obsessive, fanatical cycle of studying, the weird thrill that comes from achieving the overworked student aesthetic.

Through a meticulously researched and a wholly impressive deep dive into linguistics and the politics of language and translation, Kuang weaves a story that is part love-hate letter to academia, part scathing indictment of the colonial enterprise, and all fiery revolution.\\n\\nThe story is populated by complex and contradictory characters who face soul-shattering choices and stakes that rock the world. Now, I will admit there are a few places midway that drag a bit for those of us who are not scholars of linguistics, but they are laying groundwork for an explosive and thrilling conclusion. Not only is the story deftly plotted, but the prose flows, and complex ideas are made easily digestible and intriguing. There are a handful of footnotes used to great effect (and I am not usually a fan of footnotes in fiction but they work perfectly here) and even some smartly placed interstitial chapters.\\n\\nOverall, Kuang pulls no punches in the sharp, brilliant, heartbreaking, heart-filling, and all together satisfying story.

       " 'Right, so… this really wasn’t the book for me. Oh dear, I have a lot of issues, but remember: if you loved this book, that’s valid, but you didn’t, it doesn’t mean you aren’t “intelligent enough”. To be honest, after reading that, I’ve become convinced more than ever that people rate a book highly purely based on the fact it covers important topics to avoid “looking racist” rather than actually rating how a book handles and discusses racism and incredibly important discussions such as capitalism, colonialism and its long-standing, horrific impact.\\n\\nHad this book been marketed as a YA, I would have been more forgiving. The deep topics covered (linguistics, academia, colonialism, racism, capitalism) are discussed in an overly simplistic, patronising way that talks down to the reader. (Us poor non-Oxbridge types are clearly too uneducated to formulate our own readings of any imagery, and can’t possibly understand complex ideas. Here, let the author ensure you understand it by emphatically overemphasising the obvious in the narrative and adding footnotes to boot, just in case even that’s too difficult for you to understand).\\n\\nThere are several issues of note, primarily the bombardment of themes and topics which all exist at a superficial level, and none are covered well. Let’s break them down:\\n\\n1. Racial stereotyping and cartoonish presentation of microagressions.\\n\\nRacism is rarely subtle, especially during this period. There’s no need to question the overt nature of racism, but the way it’s presented is rather cartoonish. As someone who doesn’t experience racism, I can’t really speak on the matter in terms of realisticness, but as a reader, from my perspective, the overt racism and micro aggressions were presented in an almost comical manner which undermined the emotional intensity of the experiences of the character subjected to it. It read like a book introducing children to the subject of racism and how to identify it in very overt way rather than an adult discussing the impacts of racism and how atrocious, insidious microagressions affect academics in elitist institutions and beyond.\\n\\nOn top of this, the one-dimensional, stereotyped characters seemed to undermine the anti-racist sentiments. These interesting figures were reduced to their identities complete with racial stereotypes, making them feel like props being used to express the author’s message rather than existing as characters in their right, whose existence inadvertently raises awareness to important topics of discussion. The characters had no complexity or depth, and the relationships between them weren’t developed or explored: they just were. I felt like they were used as a checkbox for diversity or mouthpieces rather than existing in their own right, and that, again, felt hypocritical considering the plot of the book.\\n\\nI mean, you can’t criticise racism and then reduce all your characters to caricatures of their racial and social stereotypes. I mean, come on — you made the Irish girl THROW A POTATO AT SOMEONE for crying out loud. Good grief.\\n\\n\\n2. Hypocritical and overly simplistic discussion on linguistics.\\n\\nFor a book about language and the importance of its impact, there’s a bizarrely hypocritical employment of it. It doesn’t make sense to write a historical novel about language if you then employ politically contemporary language to develop your characters’ identities, and how they self-identify. Why make it a historical novel at all if you disregard the language limitations of the period? Why write about the nuances and inadequacies of language within a historical period if you ignore all the limitations of language during that period and instead have your characters understand race and discussions about race and identity with language that’s only come into existence in the past 50 years?\\n\\nThe ultra-contemporary political language concerning, and understanding of, race, colonialism, imperialism, class, wealth, oppression etc weren’t authentic to that period, and this doesn’t make sense because there were activists and academics writing about these issues during this period and they do so in their own language and lexicon. Why do so much research into this period only to disregard the language of that period, especially when you’re writing a book about language and the magic system revolves around language?!\\n\\nAdditionally, I’m not a linguist or translator, but the discussions on linguistics, etymology, translation, etc seemed incredibly basic to me, which added to the feeling of being perpetually patronised by the author.\\n\\n3. An undeveloped magic system under a thinly veiled metaphor\\nThe magic system was so original in nature yet failed miserably in execution. I think people really underestimate how difficult magic systems are to create: they think they can just throw in magic and that’s all that’s necessary. Don’t get me wrong, Kuang can write when she actually does it, but rather than write a scene, Kuang chooses to summarise it, and the same goes for her magic system. I really dislike books which tell, not show, and this whole book is written in this way, and the same law applies to its magic system.\\n\\nThe book is straddling two genres- history and fantasy. Its history is fine, nothing outstanding or worthy of praise, but you would expect adding magic to this period would change it in some meaningful way. But it doesn’tI’m not entirely sure how this benefitted from being a fantasy. Everything about this period is the same despite these being magic at their disposal. The magic in this book has the same impact on the society and period as a pink lady apple. Imagine someone writing a historical fiction about the 19th century with a magical element about it - a pink lady apple. This is impossible, pink lady apples weren’t invented until 1973. But this author decides to include it as an essential part of the plot. Yep. As you’d imagine, that wouldn’t have much impact, and the magic in this book has the same degree of impact.\\n\\nIf the world isn’t fundamentally changed by silver, why are we supposed to care? I’m not excited about silver, like I wouldn’t be exited about a pink lady apple being in the book. If it doesn’t transform the world as we know it, how are we supposed to invest in this universe and care about the fate of silver?\\n\\nI really felt Kuang doubted the ability of their readers to understand literature and read metaphors. They were so heavy-handed with spelling out that the magic system of silver was a metaphor for the industrial revolution I felt like I was reading the Spark notes to a novel rather than a novel itself. It’s ok, Kuang. You can let the reader take the book into their own hands. She seemed to be terrified at the idea of a reader not acknowledging or picking up on every “ingenious” literary technique she employed that she forced us to acknowledge every essence of it. This would be the easiest book for a literature student to analyse, because the author gave us all the answers. She needs to trust the reader’s intelligence, and she needs to let go of the idea that literature can be read in ways she never intended it to be.\\n\\n4. Preachy mouthpieces that don’t fit the characters or time period\\nOk, so we’ve covered the fact that Kuang uses inaccurate political language regarding race and social status for this period of time (and the characters have an awareness of these issues in a language which is unbefitting to the period). But Oh GOD, the Opium debate. This is probably where I got the most irritated. No offence to Gen Z, but there’s a stereotype of your generation for being preachy know-it-all/experts in every possible situation, and this scene really fell into that stereotype (I don’t agree with this stereotype of you, by the way, I’m just using the stereotype as an example so you can picture this scene).\\n\\nIn this scene, Robin, the naive, sheltered little translation student suddenly, out of no where, becomes an expert in the health and social implications of Opium and it’s the most staged, preachy, inauthentic and random scene that it stood out like a sore thumb. I don’t disagree with anything he said, but it felt totally contrived and moralistic (superior know-it-all student knows all about a random subject unrelated to anything he’s discussed in the book so far against very overtly greedy, selfish evil British man - it was cartoonish). By the end of the scene, I expected the other guy to snap his fingers at Robin and scream “YAHS QUEEN”. It felt like I was reading a debate on Twitter where someone was perfectly citing facts they googled quickly to back up their position, posing as an expert despite clearly knowing nothing about the subject until a very superficial understanding of it.\\n\\nThis discussion is so important. In fact, this book covers such important discussions and topics, but they’re presented in such a lazy way that they might as well have been blog posts on the issue rather than plopped into a work of fiction. This kind of event occurred several times throughout the book, but this was the most heavy-handed and extensive and it stuck out to me, haunting me all the way to the point I wrote this darn review.\\n\\nThere was nothing clever about how these important issues were discussed and raised. It was boring and straight forward, as if catering to young adults learning about life issues for the first time rather than adults. People criticising the book saying “it reads like a textbook/academic article) are being FAR too complimentary — the most important elements are written like a blog post.\\n\\n5. On a personal note, I’m rather fed up of the glorification of Oxbridge universities. They’ve been historically heralded as the pinnacle of academic prestige, despite centuries of nepotism and upper-class biases underlying their admittance process (which is, ironically, highlighted in the book). Academics exist all over the world in a wealth of institutions. Can we stop this overdone trope of the ivory towers, please? I’m bored.',\n",
       " \"With a unique magic system, a story drawn from real historical events and periods, and a book that combines the skills of translation and communication with the love for language and words then this should have been one of my favourite Fantasy novels this year. Afterall, it had all the ingredients to make it so. However, it fell short on the substance around the key themes, the storytelling, world building, the plot and also the characters.\\n\\nAs the reader I felt the authors view / history lesson took centre stage to the detriment of more developed characters. Disappointing when there was so much scope to portray more diversity and uniqueness in this group of people which the author herself created. A huge disappointment in a book I had deliberately kept aside for the right moment to read.\\n\\nI will go straight into why?\\n\\n⭐⭐ – if you remove the historical detail and references, there was not much of a plot and storyline for me. The historical detail felt repetitive, constant and after 500+ pages - monotonous. Yet the context and important detail was missing in the scenes, sub plots, backstory, and conversations. For example, they managed to recruit a young Robin into the underground movement in the first month - yes even in fantasy some things can be far-fetched. Yet we didn't get any real insight into his aspirations, inclinations, principles and motives until much later and even then it was light. Robin also assisted the underground movement in some of their covert operations but then we never got to hear what these exercises involved or how successful they were.\\n\\nThere are also a number of plot holes and threads that don’t tie up and some actions that don’t make sense. Like a secret society leaving messages on Robin’s window to inform him what to do next - well that’s safe no one would ever look there!!!\\n\\n⭐ was a bit uninspiring and underdeveloped in the book. At one point using silver bars was considered so strong it could kill and so as a reader I was braced for a unique and powerful force to play its role in the plot and the lives of the characters but then it's 'magic' all but disappeared in the book, although there were references to the commercial side of the silver trade and the dynamic it created among nations.\\n\\n⭐⭐ - As a lover of history, I am always fascinated by the past in all its beauty, ugliness, ingenuity, ambition, wars, the politics, and the evolution of societies and people. I am also keen and a strong advocate of exploring history and world politics through a different lens. So, I thought a different perspective combined with England in the 1800s would provide the perfect backdrop for a dark Fantasy that is inspired by history and real historical events. Afterall, there is much to regret and reflect on, such as colonialism, sexism, racism, the distribution of wealth between classes at home and abroad, and much to applaud like the industrial revolution and medicine.\\n\\nHowever, for me personally, there was a disconnect between the fictional story and the historical backdrop, in this book. At times I felt I was immersed in a world of magic and then the writing switched to the author almost critically lecturing the reader on historical events, some of which felt angry but certainly more intense, anti-west and also anti-white at times. This was just the wrong tone, wrong messaging and wrong type of detail for a fantasy book and for my personal tastes. Perfectly fine for a history and non-fictional book which I read a lot of, but not a fantasy where the authors own views seemed to dominate the book and opinions Kuang was keen to express. Wrong platform but right sentiment – in many ways.\\n\\n⭐⭐ - In magical realism and fantasy almost anything goes, and I rarely question historical factualism. However, in this case because the author provided endless commentary on socio-economics, geo-politics and history, I found myself question the historical accuracy and credibility of what was written which in itself was an issue because this was not what this book was supposed to be. I did not want a history lesson or should I say the authors one-sided view of history, which I could challenge in a lot of places.\\n\\n⭐ The author also went over the top with footnotes which also made this feel like a history book instead of a novel. After a while I stopped reading them because few footnotes actually embellished the story. In addition, we were treated with some beautiful and inspiring quotes from a random selection of prominent figures like Wordsworth, Shakespeare, Pluto, Victor Hugo, Lewis Carroll, and even the book of Genesis, but the connection to the story and the chapters was notably missing - again. So, I have to question the purpose and relevancy of the footnotes and quotes and what they were meant to achieve.\\n\\n⭐ - The character development in the story was regrettably unconvincing and 'thin' and so it was difficult to feel invested in a cast who all sounded similar and indistinguishable at times, because they were created as shells with a mouth that was needed to deliver the authors personal view and message.\\n\\nThe author really missed a trick here because the characters represented different nations, cultures, and diversities which could have brought so much to the story. In the end my only take from them was that they were carbon copies of the author, but also unlikeable and even untrustworthy as they deceived each other and displayed little depth, substance and principles. However, they did offer more interest as a small body of people because the group dynamics kept changing, and with it deception and betrayal in the story.\\n\\nI will come back to summarise the plot - in essence a young orphan Robin Swift is taken to England by his new / real father, to study at Oxford where he meets three other people, all of whom have been successful in obtaining a place because of their language and translation skills. As politics and ambition on the global scale intensifies, so to does the survival and safety of the group as their own personal views are set to conflict with those of the university, the country they came from and the one they now live in.\\n\\nPlease read other reviews because I just did not connect with the characters, the plot or storyline. There was so much unnecessary detail I found this a challenge to finish. The authors views made this feel too personal and the wrong platform to express them, but overall this ‘part history’ book did not hit the mark as a ‘Fantasy’ novel. I can relate to dark themes and storylines and hard hitting topics and messages but a strong underlying negative tone is not for me. I feel it is much more effective to guide and encourage but not preach or direct the reader towards an authors POV but some of this was bordering on provocative which does not resonate or sit well with me, and what a shame because I was really looking forward to this one.\\n\\nToo much detail where we didn't need it and not enough where we did.....\\n\\nand to finish with one of my favourite Charles Dickens quotes which was used in the book\\n\\nand in a word - 'Disappointing'.\",\n",

Again, I know many readers thought that the book was long and boring, but I was hooked up from page 1. As Casteel is held prisoner by The Blood Queen, Poppy is raising her army. She has the draken and wolven behind her, but she also needs the support of the Atlantians if she hopes to win the war, kill Isbeth, and save her King.\\n\\nThe Gods and Primals’ history and significance are more important in this book, hence my recommendation to read ASITE first. I thought that the main villain in this series would be The Blood Queen and her allies, but I realize now that I was sorely mistaken and that the war has only begun. I am so happy that I enjoyed this book when so many others did not, and I am very excited for the next one.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis book is filled with heartache, rage, sorrow, angst, and love. The suffering Casteel endures broke my heart, and seeing Poppy and Kieran in pain and desperate to find him and save him before it was too late was painful. I do love angst, and I had a good dose of it in this book. Oh, how I wanted to see Callum and The Blood Queen die a painful and slow death. I hate them so much, but at the same time, I’m happy that I hate them because it means that I am so much more involved in the story.\\n\\nI knew Cas would eventually be rescued, I also know that he would persevere and endure, no matter what because he’d rather be the one suffering than Poppy. But among all that despair and rage, there was also hope because he knew that his Queen would come for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoppy becomes even more confident in this book. The stakes are higher than ever before, and she tries her best to win a war without killing innocents or destroying cities. She also has to deal with the Atlantian generals that are doubtful about her and her ability to rule, and we could see how she hurt and how the weight on her shoulders was slowly becoming too much. Cas, as usual, was a perfect supporting husband. Never try to stop her or to tell her that she couldn’t do what she wanted to do. He trusts her completely and gives her the power over her life that she didn’t have in all of her years as The Maiden. Their love is inspiring and beautiful… And it’s also full of passion and sexy moments. 😏\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCas and Kieran’s love and fierce loyalty for each other is so wholesome and heartwarming. I love them with all my heart and seeing how much they care for each other and would do anything for each other was beautiful. This is some higher lever bromance here. I have loved Kieran from the start, but I do have one complaint here… Even though he is much more present, which I adored, he lacked a certain depth. This uniqueness that he had in the second and third books was forgotten here and he had such a Cass-like-behavior at times, which I don’t mind if it’s a few times, but in this book, while I love his relationship with poppy, I feel that his behavior changed quite a lot to mimic Cas’ behavior when he is with Poppy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoppy and Kieran definitely get closer to each other emotionally and physically in this book. I know that some readers saw this as “emotional cheating”, which I respect, but I did not see it that way. They are both going through the same emotional pain after losing Cas and they are doing all they can, including risking their lives in crazy plans to save him. Cas himself does not mind them getting closer and does not see it as cheating, nor does he see Kieran as a threat. On the contrary, Cas is the one bringing them all together, and I truly believe that Poppy will need both of them to keep her in check in the future with her growing powers and this damn prophecy saying that she’s the Harbringer and that she will remake the realms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three of them clearly love each other. Poppy and Cas can love Kieran, without loving each other less. They both love Kieran and it is heartwarming, sweet, and beautiful. I would not mind a throuple at all in the next book, because even though I ADORE Cas and Poppy, them also loving Kieran and Kieran loving them does not diminish the heartmate bond and the fact that they would do anything for each other (please don’t hate me for this). On the other hand, I would also love it if Kieran finds his own heartmate or his own special person, so I would be happy with both options.\\n\\n\\n(but seeing how every hateful readers ranted about chapter 44 on every social media, you probably already know about this mild spoiler)…\\n\\n\\n\\nI just love how the relationship between Cas, Poppy, and Kieran is getting deeper with each book. It is clear that Cas and Kieran have a special connection, and seeing how Poppy grew on Kieran and how she learned to rely on him and to love him was precious. I am happy that Kieran was more important in the plot this time, and that he was more present all throughout the book. We can see that things are starting to change between Poppy and Kieran, of course, her heartmate remains Cas, but she definitely feels something that’s more than friendship for Kieran. The three of them just have this symbiotic connection, and I love how it might turn out for them. I know that many people were against the idea of The Joining or against the idea of Kieran getting involved in Poppy and Casteel’s relationship, but to me, it just makes sense that they will (hopefully) find a way to make it work because they all love each other deeply. That is what a throuple sounds like to me, and I am not ashamed to say that I would love that for the rest of this series.\\n\\nNow, about all those hateful and rude comments… I do believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that 100%, but I also believe that there is a way to share one’s opinion while remaining civilized and respectful.\\n\\nI saw many hateful reviews saying that the fact that Poppy was growing closer to Kieran while Cas was imprisoned was disgusting, that The Joining made no sense because Cas would never share Poppy and that the scene just came out of nowhere to please a few horny fans on Facebook.\\n\\nThe concept of The Joining was introduced in the second book. From the very start, Poppy shows that she is not disgusted by the idea of sharing blood between 3 people and maybe something more in the heat of the moment. There are also a few hints of Poppy and Kieran potentially getting physically closer (the scene where he is behind her as Cas drinks from her, when they’re all sleeping together while traveling to Atlantia, or when he was holding Poppy while she was drinking from Cas and also having sex with him in the third book).\\n\\nI also distinctly remember in the second book, when Poppy awakes to find Kieran sleeping right behind her while she was cuddling Cas, she says that it was as if Cas was a magnet that drew them both. The hints were there, and the fact that they are now sharing the same anguish and pain with the temporary loss of Cas can very well explain why they grew closer to each other. Also, Poppy and Kieran developing a stronger and more intimate bond does not mean that she wants to replace Cas, or that she loves him less.\\n\\nNow, concerning the comments stating that “real men don’t share”… Let’s keep in mind that Cas and Kieran share a very strong, ancient, and unique bond. They’re not just best buddies, they grew up together and they trust each other with their life, their connection is a strong one. Cas did not get jealous or angry at Kieran the few times he saw Poppy naked or had a front-row seat for some intimate moments, nor did Cas get angry or possessive when Poppy saw Kieran naked. More than once.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will finish this segment on the Joining by saying that I think the relationship between Poppy and Kieran was well done and it started in the second book, it did not appear suddenly in this one. I also strongly believe that there is a way for Poppy, Kieran, and Cass to love each other without diminishing the love they have for each other. Cas and Kieran have been very close for centuries so it does make sense in a way, and I do not believe that The Joining was there only to add some spice and to please some fans. It just shows how close the three of them have become and how they could manage to share everything together.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI adored Reaver and his “I don’t really give a shit” attitude in this book, but I would have loved to see more of the drakens. Reaver’s an odd one for sure, but he added many funny moments in this book, and I want more of him in the next one!\\n\\nI would also have loved to have more of Delano and Netta. While I am happy that Kieran was more important, most of the book follows him, Poppy, and Cas, and we do not really know what is happening with the Atlantian army, with the other wolven, and with the drakens that stayed behind. I feel that Poppy did not have any time with them, or the generals, or the other “important” Atlantians, which would definitely help her gain their trust and know better how to organize her army.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI said earlier that while I would enjoy a throuple, I would also love it if Kieran found his own special person or even heartmate. Am I the only one that was hoping for a hate-to-love relationship to develop between Kieran and Reaver? There is definitely tension between them, and I’m not sure it’s 100% angry tension if you know what I mean. Apparently, the author already confirmed that it would not happen, but it would have been nice. I really like their snarky interactions and how Reaver just didn’t seem to give a shit about anything besides burning humans and annoying Kieran.\\n\\nAlso, a special mention to Malik and Millie who are both quite intriguing, Millie even more than Malik. I fully expect to see them again in the next books, and their role in this war is definitely not over. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil anyone, but let's just say that there is potential for me to like these two in the next books if they make good decisions.\\n\\nOverall, I did love this book very much. The last 10% were INTENSE and I am already excited for the next book. I know that many people were disappointed, but all I can say is to at least give it a chance, and not base your opinion only on all the 1-star reviews, and hopefully, you will enjoy it as much as I did!\\n\\n\\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n⭐⭐⭐⭐.5\\n\\n\\n\\nFanart by Emilia Mildner\\nI will most definitely be looking for more fanarts in the next few weeks\\n\\n\\n🙂\",\n",
       " \"– 3.5 stars\\n\\nI’ve finally read this book and formed my own thoughts on everything that happened. And while it’s my least favorite in this series so far (or more likely tied with TCOGB), it wasn’t because of the scene why everyone is giving this 1 star and the consequences. I’m shocked myself, but this book actually triggered another pet peeve of mine. 😂👀\\n\\nEven though this book already got spoiled thanks to half of GR and twt users who didn’t bother to put a spoiler tag in their rage about certain things.\\n\\n❗❗❗  ❗❗❗ \\n\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n\\nAll thoughts are my own and how *I* interpret the events in this book. If you disagree that’s fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about his book, if you can disagree in a civil manner great, but refrain from leaving hate comments on here. 😪\\n\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n\\nOne of my biggest pet peeves are between the couple. If I have a say, then the couple wouldn’t be separated for more than 15% of a book at a time. And the fact that we needed to wait til the ~52% mark to see a Poppy & Cas reunion and ~60% until Cas was free of Isbitch was just waaaayy too long. I don’t count these dream walking thing Cas & Poppy did. This series works for me because of the romance between Poppy & Cas, take that away and what am I reading for? Surely not for the complicated world building, info-dumping, 30592 different terms that are thrown in to describe vampires, dragons and wolves, or the snail-moving plot. So I was sad to see that it took so long to free Casteel.\\n\\nThe long separation is the main reason why I didn’t love this book, cause the first half of the book didn’t feel like Poppy & Cas’ story anymore. Casteel was pretty much pushed to the sideline. But on another note, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Casteel’s POV chapters!! Been waiting 3 books for his POV and his chapters didn’t disappoint me, cause reading how much he loves Poppy always makes me feel 🥰🥰🥰. Even tho his POVs are a little one-dimentional, since they focus so much on his devotions to Poppy and how perfect she is, I didn’t mind it that much, cause there are worse things to read about than an obsessed Hero completely whipped for his queen. 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️💅 \\n\\n↬\\n\\nIf you’re friends with me or have read some of my reviews then you might know that I’m #1 president of hating everything that has to do with 3somes, sharing, RH or poly relationship in books. I have nothing against them or the people who read these things and love to read about it, I just don’t want to read that in books myself, because I don’t think it’s romantic. So I’ve been ANTI-JOINING since book 2 when the joining was mentioned, but deep down I always knew the possibility it would happen was there, since there was enough foreshadowing in book 2 & 3.\\n\\nDo you know what I did first when I opened this book? I looked up the word “Joining” you can’t believe the disappointment I felt when I read through all the mentions and saw it happening in Chapter 44. I was crushed, but not surprised. Before starting, I skimmed through the joining scene and YOO’ WTF THE CONFUSION?! I looked like this\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat’s with all the mouths, tongues, hands, fingers everywhere?! which hand belongs to whom? whose fingers are in Poppy’s vajayjay? Did they have sex or not and if yes who penetrated her? Whose cum was on her back? WHAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS, MARIA AND JOSEPH IS HAPPENING???! I’ve read this scene three times (i’m a masochist okay) and still don’t fully understand all the mechanisms that went into this scene, cause JLA made it so fucking unclear!? She should have made the joining full on porn (so at least the ‘horny soccer moms’, as the haters say, would be happy about it) or even better not letting the joining be sexual at all, but what’s done it’s done. I’ve read this book and understand the context and why the joining happened. I’m feeling better about it & can accept it for what it is and the purpose it served, cause the joining happens for a reason, since Kieran was cursed by Callum and Poppy & Cas went with the joining to protect him and tie Kieran & Cas’ lives to Poppy. Basically when Poppy dies, they die, otherwise all of them are going to live as long as she does.\\n\\nAnother thing I want to talk about is “fan service” what people have been throwing around and screaming with their whole ass chest. I’ll be honest, when I saw that the joining was happening, my first thought was: “Why did JLA had to cave to the demands of the pro-joining ppl?” But after sitting on this for a couple of days now and seeing the shitstorm that this release caused, I came to the conclusion that JLA did the opposite of fan serving. I’m fully convinced that she wrote the joining KNOWING the RISK that a lot of people are going to be outrage with it and lose interest in the series all together. Her putting the joining scene in was actually a bad business move, since she’s losing so many more readers & potential readers (those who wanted to wait til the series is finish to start/wanted to wait to see if the joining is happening) and she did it anyway. Fan service would have been to not make the joining sexual at all, cause then the anti-joining/anti-sharing fraction would be happy and while the pro-joining group might be disappointed, they would probably still continue with this series nonetheless. Do I think she made the wrong decision? Hell yeah. But I respect that decision, cause it’s her series, it’s her characters and she did what she thought felt right, even knowing that it would make a lot of people upset and they might drop this series.\\n\\n↬\\n\\nafter reading all these 1 star reviews, it wasn’t the joining scene that gave me the most anxiety going into this book, but everyone who said there is “emotional cheating” from Poppy and Kieran.\\n\\nand I’m positively surprised, but that’s not AT ALL how I felt reading this book. What might be seen by others as “emotional cheating” and “flirting”, was trauma bonding in my eyes. Poppy lost the love of her life and Kieran lost his best friend when Cas was captured. Both of them lost what might be -the most important person for them- at that moment and it’s only natural that they started to lean on each other more. TWOTQ clearly shows a huge relationship progression between Poppy & Kieran, but they ALWAYS had this dynamic where Poppy was asking a lot of question, whereas Kieran was replying dryly to them & seeming annoyed with them, but secretly loving it. In this book Kieran was less sarcastic and more playful with Poppy (what can be interpret as flirting), but in my opinion Kieran only tried to cheer Poppy up, because he saw how down she felt without Cas. Kieran slept with Poppy in the same bed, but only in wolven form, expect one time when Poppy woke up after a nightmare (I think?) and Kieran turned back in human form, but nothing about that scene was sexualised. Kieran was very touchy with Poppy, but that still felt platonic to me and how you would console your best friend. Cas was so thankful for that Kieran was there for Poppy when he could not, there was not one trace of jealousy from his side, because Kieran is the person he trust the most. There is literally no angst and everything between Poppy, Cas & Kieran is mutual.\\n\\nThen the whole Poppy having feelings mess. This is where it gets complicated and messy. This is the point where I can understand the concerns of some readers, because my biggest concern after TWOTQ is not knowing where the romance aspect is going. Poppy is young, Cas is her first love and she has not much experience with love, so I kinda get that she’s feeling confused about her feelings about Kieran. But at the same time she described it as not romantic love like she has for Cas, but more than she felt for Delano/Vonetta. I just think as humans, we like to label things. So there is either platonic love or romantic love. If it doesn’t fit in neither category it’s hard to grasp, but that’s exactly what I think Poppy & Kieran have.\\n\\nJLA was very sneaky with her writing that I could see it go both ways. Either 1. Cas & Poppy are staying exclusive, but having a very close bond with Kieran or 2. This whole thing is turning into a poly relationship, since it wouldn’t take that much since they already crossed the line with the joining and Kieran is already very protective of Poppy. It doesn’t help that Kieran is talking in riddle when Poppy asked him about what kind of love he feels\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCAN THIS GET ANY MORE CRYPTIC BRO? I feel like I’m back in literature class and forced to analyse every single word in a poem to find its hidden meaning. 😭 it’s such a struggle and could be interpreted any way.\\n\\nWhile I’m 75% sure that this thing is not going to turn into a poly relationship. Poppy and Cas are heartmates for fuck sake, why bring Kieran in this throuple, if the relationship would be so unbalanced? Poppy and Cas are King and Queen, where would that leave Kieran if it’s a poly relationship - the side piece? Kieran deserves his own person who loves him unconditionally and not only “more than platonic, but less than romantic, just different”. He deserves better than that. When Cas said I’m holding onto that “IF” with my dear life. The rest of the 25% of me is scared shitless that this is going to turn into a poly relationship, cause I 👏🏽 don’t 👏🏽 want 👏🏽 that and there are hints that could go either way. I had two books to mentally prepare for a joining, that’s why I’m disappointed, but can somehow live with the joining, because for me it was a one time thing. We had three books to get attached to Poppy and Cas as a couple and including Kieran in this relationship wouldn’t hit the same. I’ve been trying to be understanding with everything that’s been going on so far and tried to all sides. I can even understand why Poppy & Kieran developed certain feelings to a point, because of the circumstances they are all in and it’s hard to not catch any kind of feelings under that kind of pressure and when so much is at stake. But I’m really really hoping that those confused feelings are getting cleared up in the next book.\\n\\nI’m trying to hold off my judgement for now, cause we don’t know where this is going and JLA is getting enough hate as it is and I don’t need to add more to it. But when I’m reading Book 5 and it’s going to be a poly relationship, then I’m going to write a (respectfully 😌) rant review for sure, but until then let’s wait and see where this story will take us.\\n\\n↬\\n\\n💚 I mentioned at the beginning that I’m not reading this series for the plot. I might not have understand half of what was happening here with all the name and place dumping, I still thought that the plot of TWOTQ was better and more interesting than in TCOGB.\\n\\n💚 This series has two marks 1. Poppy being stabby 2. Poppy asking questions. While I thought that this was mentioned a bit too much in the previous book and was starting to annoy me, it was much better handled this time. It was still mentioned several time, but I didn’t had a feeling it was on every page yk.\\n\\n💚 CASTEEL’S POV!! CASTEEL’S POV!! CASTEEL’S POV!! I love this man and his devotion to Poppy.\\n\\n\\n\\n💚 Side character appreciation time: can we talk about Reaver for a moment or two?! I love that drakken with my whole ass heart. He is so grumpy and dry. Like come on, how can you not love him. Reaver is so unintentionally funny without wanting to be. 😭 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTell me Reaver is not a mood. 🤣\\n\\n💚 MALIK & MILLICENT?! HELLO I’M INVESTED. 👀👀 I’m so curious to know why he knows they are heartmates, but she doesn’t. These two went through so much under Isbeth’s tyranny and I can’t imagine what horrors they had to witness. Also Malik staying at Isbeth’s side all these years only for Milli ugh my heart. 🥺🥺🥺 these two characters have so much potential, not only with each other, but Malik and Cas sibling relationship needs to be fixed and I hope we see some brotherly bond in the next books. Also Milli being Poppy’s sister?! Of course I wanna see some sibling relationship with them too. There is so much to explore.\\n\\n💚 ISBITCH IS DEAD. All I wanted is Poppy kicking her mother’s ass and while it took a very long time, I’m so happy with the result, cause that bitch finally died a cruel death. Nothing less than what she deserved.\\n\\n\\n\\nUff, this was a lot of things to unpack and i’m sorry for this long review, but the negativity surrounding this book made me upset and needed an outlet. It felt therapeutic writing everything down. Thank you to everyone who made it this far. All I want to say is that I understand that people are very upset/mad/disappointed/angry about the joining and Poppy x Kieran relationship development and where it might lead, but that is not a reason to be nasty to the author. Calling her names, making threats, wishing her harm, and so much more that I’ve been seeing in the last few days. All of that, 👏🏽👏🏽. You can write your 1 star review and tear that book apart in a respectful way. (as the words in this book have proven more than enough). JLA is a human too with feelings. She even said in her reader’s group that she has thick skin, but is in a dark place after all these hate messages that are coming her way.\\n\\n»»-------------¤-------------««\\n\\n\\n\\nAlright, the hate this book receives is getting out of hand. I get that a lot of people are very disappointed right now, because they didn't want certain things in this book to happen and they did (myself included). But frankly, some of y'all who rated this book 1 star without EVER reading this series are just pathetic.

       " \"**SPOILERS**\\nI was just going to have a good time celebrating how good this book was. But noooo, people had to be gross and piss me off. The fact that some readers are insulting and attacking “middle aged Facebook moms”… Let me be clear:\\n\\n- Using “middle aged moms” as an insult is very sexist and ageist and just fucking gross.\\n- I can't believe I have to explain this, but here we fucking go: Women exist and have their own interests and desires and ambitions past their 30s and after having kids, too. Your mom? Yeah buddy, she is a person. Shocking, I know.\\n- Trying to insult someone for something they can’t change (like their body, age, sexuality…) is fucking disgusting and you should be ashamed.\\n- The blatant misogyny makes me sick to my stomach.\\n- Slut shaming women (“horny soccer moms”) is nasty. Don't pretend like we aren't all reading these spicy romance books for anything but what it is. So if those women are horny, so are you.\\n- And lastly: those old FB moms have better reading comprehension than you do so why don’t you show some respect, huh?\\n\\nSo here’s my analysis of the series for those saying the Joining and Poppy's feelings for Kieran came out of nowhere. Because, honestly? It’s hilarious to see people complaining about JLA pandering to some readers when, Don’t believe me? Here are the receipts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nintrigued\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first book only had a subtle hint, but it was there, regardless, proving JLA wrote this series with this relationship in mind from the start.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Joining is introduced. And it’s said the exchange of blood between the three can become very intimate, leading to sex. Poppy says she’s not repulsed or disgusted by the idea. She just doesn’t know how it would work. And she keeps bringing it up. To Casteel and even Vonetta. She’s , to quote the book.\\n\\nThen Casteel has to feed and Kieran stays in the room with them to make sure he won’t hurt Poppy. And even to make Cas press them both against the wall, trapping them together.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the scene that made me realize we were getting a throuple in this series was when the three slept together and this happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe line about Casteel being a magnet that drew them both made me realize this wasn’t going to be just about Poppy. These two men had a connection, too. I wasn’t sure if things would be platonic or not between them, but I knew if Kieran joined their relationship, it’d include Cas too.\\n\\n\\n\\nCasteel is too possessive to share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmeat\\n\\nCasteel to Kieran.\\n\\nIn this book, JLA increased the tension and sexuality of their scenes together. And this scene is a perfect example. In the previous book, Cas fed from Poppy while Kieran held her. In this book, Poppy feeds from Cas while they have sex Kieras holds her, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight after this scene, Poppy and Cas thank Kieran for his help, and this intimate scene happens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoppy is upset about the bond between Cas and Kieran being broken. They reassure her it’s okay because their relationship was more than the bond. And this foreshadowing happens:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo me, this symbolizes the idea that Poppy, Kieran and Cass could love each other without diminishing the love they have for the other, and how they could just “make room” for the other.\\n\\nKieran starts to be a lot more touchy-feely with Poppy, too:\\n\\nAnd of course, things escalate even more when Casteel gets Poppy off while she watches Kieran getting head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCasteel:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLater on, Casteel’s father says they should choose an advisor and Poppy says she already knows who she wants, referring to Kieran.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could this be hinting at, I wonder? lol\\n\\nLater on, Willa even offers Poppy to answer her questions if she becomes “curious enough.” Come on, y’all. This is starting to be too obvious.\\n\\n-\\n\\nSo yeah, this review turned into an essay on You’re allowed to dislike ménage romance, of course. But don’t insult others and don’t lie about this coming out of nowhere. It’s that simple. You are allowed to disliking this simply because it messes with your PoppyCas OTP. There’s no need to bash the author or other readers, or to say this came out of nowhere with no foreshadowing or build up.\\n\\nSo many of the 1 star ratings are from people who haven’t even read the books. Grow up. Learn from those soccer moms you are trying to insult. Be a better person.\\n\\nJesus f Christ.\\n\\n---\\n\\nApparently people think the Joining was a one time thing and there won’t be a throuple. Which baffles me because,\\n\\nAnd I bring receipts to back this up:\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all agree Cas and Poppy are madly in love with each other. But let’s establish their feelings for Kieran and vice versa at this point in the story.\\n\\nKieran:\\n\\nCasteel:\\n\\nCasteel about Kieran: that\\n\\nCasteel on Kieran’s feelings for Poppy: softened.\\n\\nThe fact that Casteel compared Poppy to Elashya is monumental to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDid Casteel just ask Poppy how Kieran’s blood tastes like while butt fingering her for the first time?? This can’t even be labeled as subtext. Also, is Casteel envious of Poppy because he hasn’t tasted Kieran’s blood before?\\n\\nPoppy:\\n\\nPoppy on her feelings for Kieran:\\n\\nTo me, this book shows Kieran and Poppy at the beginning of feeling something “more” for each other. It’s still not the same as what Poppy feels for Cas, but it's already “more” than. And there are still two more books left in the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Poppy doesn’t understand her own emotions, it’s because they are “more,” like previously stated.\\n\\nBoth Malik and Millie told Casteel he was the only one who could stop Poppy. But by then, Poppy had already asked Kieran to do just that if she ever lost control.\\n\\nThere are also several mentions of “Casteel’s and Kieran’s warmth” reaching the cold place in the center of Poppy’s chest.\\n\\nAnd the most important scene before the Joining: not\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Joining could’ve been sexual without any feelings being involved. But instead, it focused heavily on their emotions and how it felt.\\n\\n“Why have Poppy and Casteel get married and be heartmates and then ruin them with the Joining?”\\n\\nMeanwhile Casteel, right after fucking his best friend and his wife:\\n\\nAnd Poppy: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nCasteel’s POV:\\n\\nWhy would Kieran’s heart stutter at seeing Poppy? Moreover, why would JLA choose to include that if this wasn’t heading into a throuple romance?\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, to me this book ends with them at the beginning of feeling something “more” for each other. So of course nothing and everything has changed, because the romance is still developing. The same way that the intensity of their relationship has escalated in each book, it will continue to do so in the next ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd like I’ve always suspected, Kieran shields his emotions so Poppy doesn’t know he’s, in fact, turned the fuck on. But the fact that Casteel says this clearly opens the door for at least more sexual encounters in future books.\\n\\n-\\n\\nLet’s talk about the infamous “emotional cheating.”\\n\\nIt pisses me off to hear people saying Poppy cheated on Cas, when both her and Kieran were completely devoted to rescuing him. And twisting this into something ugly, saying they cheated on Cas “while he was being tortured” is so wrong in so many levels.\\n\\nIt’s funny because it’s Casteel who basically tells us readers Kieran and Poppy love each other. So where’s the cheating? Casteel sure as fuck doesn’t see it. There are so many moments where Casteel is the one bringing the three of them physically together. All this imagery is in my opinion coded as romantic.\\n\\nThey had a reason to do the Joining.\\n\\nLike Sheena said in the comments: “love isn’t a finite source.” They can love each other, and still have space and love for Kieran. And that doesn’t take from their love, only adds . Their mutual love for Kieran is beautiful, even if it’s different. But different doesn’t mean less. In fact Poppy says so herself:\\n\\nI present my last evidence:\\n\\nPoppy:\\nCasteel:\\nPoppy:\\n\\nKieran to Casteel:\\n\\nPoppy:\\nKieran:\\nCasteel:\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think the emotions were already there before the Joining and only intensified afterwards. And we are getting a throuple.\\n\\nSo, quoting Cas:\",\n",
       " '3 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️\\n\\nWARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\nI have decided to make this a spoilery review because I have no patience and I want to let it all out.\\n\\nis one of my anticipated books of the year and the fourth installment in one of my favorite series of all time.\\n\\nSo you\\'d probably be surprised by my rating, and I am too. It\\'s the first time I ever give a Blood and Ash book a rating under 4-stars. It pains me to write this as you guys know I\\'m one of the biggest fans of this series.\\n\\nDid I not enjoy this book? I did! It was great to return to this world and catch up with all my favorite characters.\\n\\nThe writing improves a lot in this book and there is less repetitiveness and internal monologue.\\n\\nMany new information is revealed in this book and some are connected to series. It made me so excited for ASITE2 also known as .\\n\\nI highly recommend reading before reading this book, several plotlines are connected to what happens in the present-day.\\n\\nMoving on, I know this comes as a big surprise that I\\'ve written all of this but you\\'ll understand where my frustration and disappointment comes from.\\n\\nI had a lot to unpack under this section so here goes...\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s get to why this book got 3-stars from me:\\n\\n1) One criticism and worry I had since TCOGB was Poppy getting a tad too overpowered. That hasn\\'t changed in TWOTQ and it seems like she is getting a new identity with every book or a new discovery about who she truly is which is getting kind of tiring. I\\'d like her to explore her current capabilities and who she is and not have that changed with every book. I want her to struggle and dive into who she is and not have a new power or identity/title in every book. At first it was empowering, but it\\'s becoming a repetitive plot-twist.\\n\\n2) I am kind of upset that secondary characters like Vonetta, Naill, Emil, and co and even Tawny did not show up much in the book. While I appreciate the closer bond Poppy and Kieran shared, I still missed the presence of those characters. I expected more of Poppy and Delano bonding because it always seemed like they had a unique bond out of all the Wolven even Kieran. Reaver is the highlight of this book though (I can\\'t believe I forgot to bring him up because he was a delight on every page!)\\n\\n3) The ending isn\\'t as explosive as I expected it. While I screamed when my baby daddy Nektas showed up. We haven\\'t had a glimpse of Ires and or any knowledge about Jadis (we know she is alive but that\\'s about it). I was anticipating more. Maybe due to the title I expected a full-scale war? I\\'m not trying to say it\\'s a bad ending, not at all it was exciting and sets up ASITE2/ALITF.\\n\\n4) Casteel\\'s character felt like a blank space. I don\\'t feel like we delved in much into him as a character beyond his focus on Poppy which truly saddens me. Don\\'t get me wrong! one of the reasons I love him is how he worships and loves Poppy, but when that turns into his sole personality? it stripped away a lot of the complexities and personality Casteel had in FBAA/AKOFAF. Of course I do not expect him to remain the same, it\\'s nornal for characters to change but Casteel\\'s change did not flesh out his character—he fell into the trap of the love interest basing his personality on his lover only. There was a lot to explore with having his POV for the first time in this book, it started out great but then became repetitive. We didn\\'t even get to see him cope much with the trauma of being in captivity again because it\\'s definitely a trigger. A lot was going on but I still wanted to see more of that.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI have decided to rewrite the following section and try to keep my thoughts coherent. Emotions are high and the book was released two days ago, a lot of what I wrote felt heavy for me so I wanted to write something that will get right into the point. This is something I even discussed with my friends as the negativity in general is getting to me and not in a good way.\\n\\nIf you loved the book and you\\'ll tell me that I\\'m reading it wrong or I interpreted it wrong—thus questioning my reading comprehension—please refrain from commenting and don\\'t you dare and gaslight me.\\n\\nI critique books from my favorite series and by my favorite authors, it\\'s not an attack on JLA\\'s person but highlighting my issues with this book. It doesn\\'t erase my enjoyment of the books she had written before whether it\\'s this series or her other works.\\n\\nThe reason most of us are feeling strongly about this is because we love this series and these characters and this world. These books saved me, that is something I will be grateful about despite my frustration about this book.\\n\\nCriticism is always valid and your experience is also valid. I bet people were shocked because this is the first blood and ash book I gave a 3-stars to and one I\\'m writing a lengthy critique for. I don\\'t put this much effort if it was a book or series I was not passionate about.\\n\\nBut let me get straight into what my biggest issue:\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is what I need JLA to clarify. This is what I have an issue with. I wasn\\'t prepared for it and it caught me off-guard. To me, the Joining was something that was brought up and likely to happen, but then again the author made sure to mention multiple times it didn\\'t have to be sexual. But there is a stark difference between a Joining, which is a one-time act, and making what\\'s between Poppy and Kieran something more than \"platonic\" when it\\'s been confirmed Poppy and Casteel are endgame and they are heartmates. Making them heartmates is setting expectations to the readers that those two are exclusive and there will be no third-party because nothing will equal to a soul bond.\\n\\nYes, I\\'ve always loved the bond and affection between Poppy and Kieran. I always took it as platonic but in a deeply affectionate way. Like how one would be around a best friend. Yes, you can even be attracted to your friends without it involving romance.\\n\\nAlso, a good point is the Joining turning sexual had no importance for the plot. People that did not sign up for a threes*me could\\'ve been spared.\\n\\nIt\\'s been vague for most readers two sides are saying there had been evidence for it or there wasn\\'t. Kieran was there during Poppy and Casteel\\'s sexual situations. The two instances he was there wasn\\'t because he was an active participant, those two scenes were the feeding scenes and he was there to put an end to the feeding and leave. I never interpreted it as something for him, he was their closest friend and the feeding situations are risky that they need a third person around for their own safety.\\n\\nAs for the beach scene, yes Poppy was getting off seeing him get a BJ but she was also looking at the threes*me and taking in everything around her and not just Kieran. It was written as an experince for her because it was a Wolven wedding and later on Cas tells her they are very open about intimacy, I never interpreted as a romantic build-up for Kieran with them. I\\'ll put it in clear: that\\'s not build-up because it wasn\\'t exclusively about him.\\n\\nIt\\'s something I expressed before but I want Kieran to have an identity of his own outside of Poppy and Casteel\\'s relationship. It\\'s obvious Poppy and Casteel will always feel for each other more than they\\'ll feel for Kieran even if they love him \"though differently\" as both mentioned. The feelings are not equal. It makes for an unbalanced trio. Part of why I didn\\'t support the joining was because Kieran was always reduced to a joining partner by some of the readers.\\n\\nYes, I knew the Joining was coming up because it was relevant to the plot and the only option besides the Heartmate Trials to connect Casteel\\'s life to Poppy\\'s along with Kieran. The Wolven is the connecting thread here. I was prepared for it even though I wasn\\'t for it. I liked that it was on Poppy\\'s terms and her choice, but the scene itself was weird. My issue here is not the Joining but it was something I was worried it would result it, but that issue took place even before chapter 44.\\n\\nWe\\'ve always had Poppy and Casteel being each other\\'s \"forever and always\" or \"two hearts, one soul\" or or or or or or or\\n\\nThe romance was exclusively about the main couple for most readers. So it\\'s not out of left field that readers are surprised and upset with the new undefined dynamic. We don\\'t even know as nothing has been clarified yet. It has nothing to do with not being open about any type of relationships. I\\'ve been rooting and invested in this couple from book 1 and now we\\'re at book 4 and there\\'s a change that did not feel organic.\\n\\n\\nThe separation of Poppy and Casteel felt like a plot-device to develop and justify a change in the dynamic and force Kieran into it. I \"loved\" Kieran before this book, but Casteel will always be the main reason I\\'m reading the books.\\n\\nIn Casteel\\'s POV, he was thinking of how undeserving he is of her and how much he loves her and on the other hand I had to read in Poppy\\'s POV how conflicted she is about the *not so platonic and confusing* feelings she started having for Kieran? This realization just hurts because of Casteel\\'s unconditional love for her, he would never have conflicting feelings about what he feels for her and for another person.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that in your criticism of this dynamic, please don\\'t disrespect or shame relationships that may not seem appealing to you.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI picked out scenes from TWOTQ that I\\'m still confused about and I think JLA wanted to go in a different direction but it didn\\'t deliver what she intended. This, perhaps, might give a better idea on why readers including myself have an issue this new undefined dynamic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReally Kieran? he thought of the beach scene on purpose and shown her a memory that made her sense arousal? while feeding which we know is very intimate.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my understanding is it\\'s not romantic love because it\\'s not the same as what Poppy and Casteel felt for each other or what Kieran felt for Elashya, the Wolven he loved long ago. But it\\'s also more than familial and friendship? So I\\'m still confused here? Further proof the feelings are not equal? Maybe yes the purpose is to show its a stronger kind of love but not the same love she feels for Casteel. But it needs to be clearer.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Tawny highlights that Kieran is acting more like Poppy\\'s husband in his absence and Poppy blushes about it and says it\\'s complicated. I get Poppy easily gets flustered but I felt like the tease is pointing out something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nagain, I\\'m confused? She doesn\\'t understand but she understands?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo if he is staring at Poppy the way he did with his dead lover, does that point to him having romantic feelings for her? Does it have to equate to the kind of love he had for the Wolven he loved and grieved? It\\'s not giving me platonic vibes.\\n\\n\\n\\nI still don\\'t understand what kind of dynamic they now have because nothing but everything has changed? It\\'s still not defined.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Poppy just got Casteel out of a bloodlust and he is back to his former self, he asked everyone (including Kieran) to leave because he wanted to be alone with Poppy. When Kieran is about to leave Poppy almost stops him and says it feels wrong to let him leave and stay with her and Casteel (that was your urge and not Casteel\\'s) when Casteel clearly wanted to be with her alone and asked the others to leave? Her heartmate? Her husband? Who should be HER FIRST PRIORITY? Then one second later she went \"it was just us and nothing else mattered\" Poppy please sort out your feelings. This is why it\\'s confusing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is post-Joining and towards the end of the book. How should I interpret it?\\n\\nThe issue is not even the Joining even if it was a one-time thing, it\\'s involving those \"feelings\" between Poppy and Kieran. What\\'s the point of Poppy and Casteel being Heartmates? They have something Kieran doesn\\'t unless we get a retcon in the next book that the Joining means Kieran even joins them as a heartmate, which will cheapen this whole thing to me. Once a soulmate romance is being set up, you know it\\'s exclusively about the people involved. It brings along \"true love\" trope. Hell there are even poly romances written to include all three or more as soulmates to create a balanced relationship. That\\'s not the case here and it\\'s too late for that. Poppy and Casteel were established to be THE couple from the first book. JLA confirmed they are endgame.\\n\\nSo changing the relationship dynamic and the way it\\'s executed wont be easy to digest and to be honest it\\'s upsetting and I\\'ll say it bluntly:\\n\\nIf you\\'ve read all of my previous reviews for this series you\\'ll understand how much love I hold for it. I\\'ve been invested in the series for almost two years and loved interacting with the fandom and this series pulled me out of depression and grief. It took a lot from me to write this and this review has a lot of intense feelings from a dedicated reader , I mainly have an issue with this particular book and it\\'s my personal opinion. FBAA, AKOFAF, and ASITE remain my absolute favorites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI will still give this series a chance since I\\'m invested in the Flesh and Fire trilogy, but if FBAA5 takes the story and the couple on a path I\\'m not happy with, then I\\'ll sadly stop there.',\n",
       " 'I was not excited about The War of Two Queens . At all. I wanted to read this book however because I grew to care a lot about the characters in the previous installments. Turns out, it is a complete mess.\\n\\nI have so much to say about The War of Two Queens. I will give you a brief.\\nBut first, I shall describe this book in a few gifs.\\nAlso, spoilers will be hidden.\\n\\nJLA writing this book; I have some cool idea. let\\'s take it to the next level with the smut *proceeds to jump over 9532 levels*\\n\\n\\nAwesome, now let\\'s make the world history a bit more complex\\n\\n\\nPerfect, the other books also lacked sex so you know it!\\n\\n\\nDoes it make sense? Does it even matter?\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, me:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbottom line >>> this book was a disaster; I was so bored reading it\\n\\nIn my previous reviews, I did a pros and cons review. However, I truly can\\'t think of anything positive to say about this one. It wasn\\'t even fun to read.\\n\\nSo here we go, the book is already 650+ pages so I\\'ll try not to make this review too long.\\n\\nI\\'ll start by addressing the points I mentioned in my pre-review and evaluate if there were any changes regarding those matters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n. Especially \"inappropriate, indecent, unseemly & co\"\\nStabbing comments STILL HERE. That infamous book wasn\\'t mentioned a lot but one is too many.\\nPoppy is getting even more sssspecial and so are the comments about this.\\n\\n\\nIT GETS SO MUCH WORSE.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not even going to assume I understand half of the things JLA made up in this book. She just tries too hard to make things more complex and man how annoying that became.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t say monologues as much as necessary words. The book was 200 pages too long.\\nThis book was way too long. In tWoTQ more events occur compared to the previous installment but at the same time, so many filler scenes. So many scenes I could\\'ve completely done without.\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe the writing improved in this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been in what you call a \"liking books\" slump. I am reading but not really connecting with the books I pick up. I don\\'t feel anything reading other than boredom sometimes. But not annoyance. And how annoyed I was when it came to some scenes in tWoTW.\\n\\nI\\'ll start by talking about the elephant in the room. Kieran. The development of this BS relation was completely unnecessary. I used to like Kieran but the turn the events took in this book was out of character and doesn\\'t add up to what we\\'ve seen from the characters so far. I wanted him to have his own story without intermingling in every single aspect of his life with Poppy and Casteel. But no. It\\'s too much to ask. He had to flirt with his imprisoned bestie\\'s wife. Think \"indecently\" of her. It\\'s just ew. Many already discussed this so I won\\'t go further. What annoyed me the most is how this new role of Kieran affected the writing of Casteel.\\n\\nCas just wasn\\'t the same in this book. It\\'s like what made us love him in the previous books, his character, was overshadowed by Poppy\\'s (he mostly thought about sleeping with her, loving her) and basically his worship of Poppy which is a true shame because he is so much better than that. The writing of his character lacked effort and was superficial. My favorite thing about the series is this couple and I said in an old review that I don\\'t think I\\'ll get tired from reading about them but I DID. Because everything is so repetitive and underwhelming at this point since I have read so many pages about them. And since the events are only \"typical\" and the sex \"enough already\". The depth of their relationship dimmed.\\n\\nInstead, JLA tried to get him more and more smutty, dirty, touching upon untraditional sexual things in this genre, and it was soooo boring. And watching this made me cringe. We had way too many sex scenes at timings that made zero sense.\\n\\nFor instance, this affected a particular event and made me so annoyed. HOW can people who are rulers be so stupid... there were two instances that were worse than the rest (that I remember at least):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother thing that annoyed me is how overpowered is Poppy. I know I have mentioned this already but I need to stress how ridiculous all of this is. JUST SETTLE. Changing what she is in every book gets old and unimaginative very fast. The plot is just recycled in many aspects in tWoTQ.\\n\\nFurthermore, I don\\'t get the history thing. It truly seems to me just JLA is just making up stuff as she goes. Trying to add extra layers to her story so it\\'s not just smut-why the books are selling (or so she thinks)- was so damn tiring because I DO NOT WANT TO READ THE HISTORY IN THE 4TH FUCKING BOOK. I am mentally prepared to read about the world\\'s history in book 1 and even 2. Pay attention to any foreshadowing. But the freakin 4th? No. I am mentally too tired to keep up with things that aren\\'t planned from the start. I have read enough books to spot the difference.\\n\\nAs for the secondary characters, I really couldn\\'t bring myself to care about any of them. Maybe Malik but that\\'s about it. The rest are just a blur because while JLA tried to make them relevant to the story, I simply couldn\\'t stay focused when it came to their scenes.\\n\\nAlso, there was not much \"War\" going on. With such a title, I expected much more.\\n\\n\\nI can go on and on about some points but that\\'s the gist of it. I didn\\'t like this book at all and while I\\'ll be reading the sequel, I am certainly not excited about it. I expected to at least have fun or get engaged in the story but nope. I was so bored instead and irritated regarding the way JLA handled some characters/scenes. It\\'s a major disappointment and truly a sad thing because I always wanted more fantasy + a bit of smut books. But if I want to read fantasy where the main theme is the romance and the smut, there are better, , and more straightforward books out there.',\n",
       " 'i wish I could give it 0 starts, but unfortunately-again- goodreads don’t allow it!\\n\\nThat, kids, is how you destroy your series when you care more about the money you’re getting than the fans (and I mean real fans, not the horny ppl who only read it because of the kink sex).\\n\\nso… this series 📉📉📉📉 it went down really fast, uh?\\nit started ok, you know? The first two books are master pieces and I will carry them in my heart (and think about this series as a duology) but Jennifer had to do the fan service, she just had to ruin it all for absolutely nothing.\\n\\nyes, she did , the famous and it was so cringe to read about, just BAD really BAD, good God there is blood in my eyes, it was HORRIBLE, she just picked up the only good thing in the series, which was the main couple and threw it in the trash just bc her fans were horny and she can’t comity to her word? It was bad.\\n\\nBut, surprisedly the joining isn’t the issue in this book. I like it? No, I hated it! But that’s not the reason this book is getting so many hate and why the rating is dropping to the floor.\\n\\nLet’s talk about the issues now:\\n\\nKieran only serves as a joining character, that is his only personality trait, that’s all ppl care about him and that is his only propose in the series. His name should be Joinieran and now I despise him. He went from favorite to garbage. Hitting on Poppy and being all there trying to seduce her while Casteel was imprisoned???? Trash, absolutely and irrevocably trash person. I completely hate him right now.\\n\\nCasteel was being hold prisoner, being tortured and only thought about Poppy, how he loved her beyond his life, how he didn’t deserve her but would make himself enough for her bc she was his life and while all that happened Poppy (his wife) and Kieran (his best friend) were having sexual tension? With bunches of emotion cheating??? Shy glances, light touches, erotic dreams, sleeping together, she wearing his shirt for sleep and he sleeping naked with her??? seriously flirting all the time and hitting on? Ppl asking if Kieran is Poppy’s husband bc of how romantic they were acting toward each other?? REALLY JLA???? And DARE you say “they weren’t flirting, you read it wrong” not honey, I didn’t read it wrong. It’s there, you wrote that.\\nThat’s TOTALLY OOC and DISGUSTING. Right here is where you destroyed the series and Poppy and Casteel for me. Just ruined. It’s trash now. You made me hate both Poppy and Kieran for their sh*ting disrespectful attitude.\\n\\nThe way she portraits Poppy and how her powers keep growing like she is the most powerful being that ever existed instead of developed her, her personality, her sexuality or her feelings better but nooo, obviously not, let’s change her personality every book. And now she, in book four, has romantic feelings for Kieran? Her husband best friend? N O P E, this is bullsh*t and now I’m disgusted towards Poppy. Casteel deserves waaaay better than her (and that mf Kieran).\\n\\nThe way she blanked Casteel personality? It’s a slap in the face to compare the Casteel from book one to this doormat version. Who is this man? Where is possessive Casteel full of personality and “touch her and you will die?” “You’re mine and I’m incredible jealously of you” And the way JLA “muted” him so she could highlight Kieran and basically make Kieran a Casteel 2.0????Absolutely not, nope nope nope. Kieran is NOT the LI he is a secondary character, Casteel is the LI and one of the main characters. Stop this bs. Just stop!\\n\\nThe way JLA said “yes guys, maybe there is a joining but the end wil be Poppy and Casteel and Kieran will find his own love interest” and now, in f*cking book 4 they are a poly love couple? If I wanted a poly love relationship I would look for a book with that and not it happening out of f*cking nowhere in the middle of the series while the main -monogamic- couple is already 100% stabilized and developed, it just screams “I have a weak and unorganized mind and I want to please some selected ppl and make some dollars💰”.\\nShe wanted to write about a poly relationship? That’s super nice, but put it in the begging of the series.\\n“Hi guys, that’s my new series, it’s an adult romance fantasy, it will have 6 books and eventually it will be a HR so be aware” but do not promise one thing to the fans and then turn around on your word bc yours horny middle age moms were salivating over d*ck and you thought about how much more money and attention you could get. How weak Jennifer mind is…\\nAnd don’t you even dare start saying “you are being prejudicial toward poly love” I’m NOT, I have NOTHING against poly love what I’m against is inconsistent ppl, like this dumb author and her dumb fan service choices.\\n\\nJLA really let the fame she conquered with this series went up in the head and it’s a sad thing bc I followed her since Obsidian and I didn’t thought she would be so low and cheap like that. But I guess soccer moms salivating over d*cks wins over consistent storyline and characters.\\n\\nNever going to read another book written by her, she just proved herself and proved bably.\\n\\n\\nByeeeeee\\nNever to be see near this author again 👋\\n\\nedit: JLA saying ppl didn’t read it right… honey, you’re embarrassing yourself, stop with it, you made a big mistake and destroyed your prime series… it s*cks, I know… but don’t start saying ppl didn’t read it right or worse “just bc some didn’t want something to happen don’t call it fan service” bc it was a huge screaming fan service and principally don’t try to say that ppl didn’t like it bc weren’t used do “not usual relationships”. This is the biggest bs I ever read. Don’t try to make it something there is not JLA, you f*ck it up trying to please your horny selected fb group and it ruined one of the most famous fantasy series (by the way, I was in the group since June 2020 and leaved it like a month ago bc I couldn’t stand how the ppl act in there so yes I pretty much know what I’m talking about bc I saw how most of the ppl acted in that group and how JLA herself act in there too and it was all disgusting).',\n",

All the 1 star reviews are really scaring me though to be honest... wish me luck!\\n\\nUpdate #3: So… I finished it. I actually was done the day it came out but was just taking these past few days to really think about my review. I don’t mean to exaggerate, but I do honestly think I was the biggest fan of this series. I can’t even recall the amount of times I’ve reread the past three books. If I must admit, this series really helped me cling to something in life during a bad time, as cliché as that sounds. I’m going to leave my five star review for the fourth one because it lived up to my personal standards of a good book (emphasis on the \"my\"). To include, I’m not going to lose hope in JLA just because all my high expectations weren\\'t met. I enjoyed most of it if I’m honest. I do think many of these comments are being brutal and rude. We’re all allowed to dislike books and authors, but some of you guys are really taking it far. I did enjoy the last three books more than this one, but as someone who’s been loving and reading this series and anticipating each release eagerly, I can’t just drop the whole series because one book didn’t live up to all my expectations. I think the next book is going to really finalize my opinion on my dedication for this series. Until then, my five star review stands. Sorry that’s a long review lol. I just wanted to be honest. If some of you want to ignore this book and treat the series as a trilogy or duology even, that’s fine, but let’s please be respectful in doing so. I’d go into a more depth review about specific opinions on the book, but I don’t want to include any spoilers. The one-star reviews were a bit terrifying, especially seeing them before I read the book, but if your decision to not read it solely comes from that reason alone, I think you should still give it a try and form an opinion for yourself. Your judgment should truly come from your own experience. Like I was for this release, I will be eagerly awaiting the next one too (JLA and her cliffhangers). Anyways, thank you all. Until book 5…',\n",

       " \"for the love of gods no threesome or joining. i adore this series and characters so much, but if i wanted to read about a threesome or a poly relationship i would've picked up a book that specifically has that. i don't need that here it would ruin the whole romance for me and i would not read anymore books from this series.\\n\\n~\\njenniferrr 😵\\u200d💫 was very excited for this series but i won't be reading anymore, the joining was a deal breaker for me so yeah\\n\\n~\\nupdate 16/03\\ni wrote the first part of this review a year ago, right after finishing the crown of gilded bones because i felt like something was off. i have screenshots of conversations with my friends and we were all like why? is? kieran? EVERYWHERE? he wouldn't leave poppy and cas alone not for a second (and by this i mean when it was just the two of them alone, or him randomly touching poppy's hair and other stuff like this) and it felt just very weird and icky i have no other way of explaining it. many other reviewers have showed the descrepancy between her saying this was planned all along and what she has been saying for years now on her facebook group. and if i may add this is the same author who once had her readers decide which couple should be endgame in a facebook poll, so if you think she had this poly relationship thing going since the beginning well you don't know her very well lol. if it was planned all along she did a terrible job at it now go cry about it under someone else's review i don't care and you won't change my mind 🧚🏼\\u200d♀️\\n\\n~\\n17/03\\nok this is the last update i'm making because some of you are clearly not understanding. let me explain to you why people are upset. poppy and casteel are heartmates, they're married and their union has been blessed by the gods. their relationship has been building and building for 3 books and for 3 books it's been just the two of them, casteel has been shown to be possessive more than once throughout the books. then you get to the 4th book and suddenly poppy has romantic feelings for kieran (all this while the author was reassuring us that their relationship was sibling like, only to then change her mind and say it's not romantic but it's not sibling like, she keeps changing her mind apparently) while casteel, her husband, her HEARTMATE, her everything, is locked away BECAUSE OF HER, rotting in a cell BECAUSE OF HER, to PROTECT HER. kieran is casteel's BEST FRIEND and while he's away rotting in a cell, held hostage by the same person who once held him hostage and destroyed him completely, he's flirting with casteel's wife. their relationship is being questioned even by characters in the book, tawny is like hello what's happening why is he acting like your husband poppy? and she has the audacity to blush and say it's complicated. the joining hasn't happened yet here, but the realtionship is already ruined. then the joining happens. for a lot of people the joining was a deal breaker, but to be very honest i could've gone over it and just skipped it, but the author ruined everything before the joining even happened. was the book marketed as a possible poly relationship? no it wasn't. and i would also like to remind you that she dragged this possible joining until book 4, but she had all the time in the world to do it before, just like she had all the time and pages to establish the poly relationship since the beginning. think about it, even if she wants to go through with the poly relationship, you do understand that it's very imbalanced? or did i skip the part where all 3 of them got married? it looks to me like kieran is just there for the smut. when people in the facebook group were hesitant about the joining, she would comment stuff like oh the joining is not always sexual, it could happen or not but it's not always sexual. so so many readers, myself included, clung to that.\\nif you read this book and you enjoyed it and you don't think she completely ruined poppy and casteel than good for you, but don't come in my comments saying i'm the dumb one for not predicting the joining would happen. it's not that, i have been a fan of this series for years and so many other readers like me are upset so it's definetly not just a me thing. i don't like the way the author is handling this with fans, gaslighting us and telling us we misinterpreted what she wrote because if so many people are saying the same thing, then maybe you should check what you write better. that's all, go write your own review if you don't agree with mine.\",\n",

JLA couldn\\'t even commit to writing it. She knew the backlash she was going to get and yet STILL didn\\'t go for it and made it a fade to black. I\\'m so sick to my stomach with the betrayal and wasted time and money that I put into this series.\\n\\nThere is very little substance to the actual plot until the last 15-20% of the book. I think ch 44 just tainted any revelations that were made, nothing mindblowing happened that this author hasn\\'t done before.\\n\\nSuch a massive disappointment. I\\'m done with FB&A. What\\'s the point anymore, really don\\'t waste your time theorizing this or trying to piece things together because it doesn\\'t matter. With the endless loopholes and quick patches to cover up hyped subplots, the answers given don\\'t make sense and, at least for me, ended up being less satisfying then ongoing theories.\\n\\nI really want to tear this book a new asshole, truly, but I\\'m so upset that I just don\\'t have the energy to anymore.\\n\\nI\\'ve lost all respect for this author.

That last ten percent was just blow after blow after blow. And Kieran was even more 🤤🥵🙃 in this. Review coming tomorrow!\\n\\nAlso, just thinking about how someone told me I was totally off with one of my theories a few months ago. Not to be petty, but I’ll be sleeping well tonight. 🤣\\n\\n\\n(Part 1)\\n\\nI’m going to split this review into three parts. The first part will be spoiler free and touch upon the story overall and aspects I enjoyed and those I feel could be improved. The second part will be in the comments and include spoilers and will address the elephant in the room that led to the inundation of negative early reviews. The third part (let’s call it “bonus content” 😅) will also be in the comments, also include spoilers and is just my thoughts on some of the stuff I’ve seen going around since release in regard to reactions to TWOTQ and stuff I’d like to point out.\\n\\nI do want to start the review by saying a couple of things first.\\n\\nBased solely out of personal enjoyment, I loved TWOTQ and that is why I have rated it five stars. However, I do have several critiques that align in some ways with folks who didn’t enjoy the book. That said, I felt like the story went in the direction I have been anticipating it would go, and it has me even more excited for A Light in the Flame and the eventual sequel to this book. Some of my theories were confirmed, and I felt the book was especially an improvement on TCOGB (which is my least favorite of the series). Further down, before I get into the spoilery part of the review, I’m going to link to two other spoilery reviews (with opposing views) that I think are worth a read and very thoughtful.\\n\\nSecondly, I have always been Team Don’t Care Either Way on the Joining. As someone who purposefully seeks out books with ménage and poly relationships because I feel represented in them, I was excited at the possibility of it happening when it was first brought up in AKOFAF. But beyond that, had no preference nor skin in the game as to whether it happened or not (I just want Kieran to be happy, okay?? 😅). So my enjoyment of the book has zero to do with where I stood on the Joining prior to going into it (or perhaps it did, because I didn’t care whether it happened or not).\\n\\nThird, I read an ARC and finished it a few days before TWOTQ released. I knew the moment I finished that this would be a polarizing book and mentioned that to a couple of other ARC readers. That said, I had zero spoilers going into the book (though I did do a spicy word search when I got the book, because a girls got to know what she can expect 😏), and I feel like this was the biggest benefit to my own reading experience (re: no spoilers). I also saw a few folks dismissing my thoughts around the book simply because I was an ARC reader and want to make clear: I have read a number of ARCs that I flat out disliked (and negatively reviewed) and receiving an ARC has zero weight on whether I enjoy a book (in fact, my favorite reviews to write are negative ones). I’ve been reviewing ARCs for almost five years now and have learned enough about my reading preferences that I simply won’t request or agree to read an ARC if I feel like I won’t enjoy the book. There are far too many books out there to read, for me to waste my time on something I won’t enjoy. I would have been reading and reviewing TWOTQ whether I received an ARC or not.\\n\\nI mention these last two things only because I’ve seen folks claim the only people who liked this book are pro-Joining people and the “JLA stans” and can tell you I’m neither—though I have enjoyed most of Jennifer’s books that I’ve read and this one is no exception.\\n\\nFinally, you should absolutely make sure you’ve read A Shadow in the Ember before reading The War of Two Queens. My recommended reading order is to read it after The Crown of Gilded Bones, but before this book. It is not simply a prequel story set in the same world—the events in that book are key to the plot of this one.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, TWOTQ is up near AKOFAF as my favorite book in the series. I loved AKOFAF because it was romance and tension heavy. It was like candy for my fantasy romance loving soul. On the other hand, I loved TWOTQ because I felt the romance versus action sides of the plot were fairly balanced—which feels like a natural progression of where the plot should be at this point. Remember in TCOGB, when it seems as though Poppy and Cas are in their room at Jasper’s house for what is like half the book?? Okay, it isn’t half, but it is definitely around a quarter of the book. That jarred me so much while reading TCOGB, it felt like work to push through those chapters, because the conversations they were having were being continually rehashed over and over again. That said, the pacing in TWOTQ is by far an improvement upon TCOGB and any repetition felt natural and necessary to that point in the story. The book had solid momentum and I always had a good sense of what the next step would be for the characters and story.\\n\\nOne of my favorite aspects of TWOTQ is the way it ties into ASITE (as I said, you need to read ASITE first!), and I was internally screaming when several of my theories on how the series tie together were confirmed. When I reviewed ASITE I was told I was wrong on my interpretation of how I thought the stories would tie together—and the petty side of my soul definitely did the “Disaster Girl” meme face when it turned out I was right. 🙊🌝 If anything, those developments blew my mind, and I’m even more excited to read A Light in the Flame now, to see just what the hell happened to bring us to this point. (Also, *whispers* Nyktos > Casteel … don’t @ me)\\n\\nNext, can we just take a moment—or five—to appreciate Reaver and his apple eating attire? Do we have fan art of this yet? My inbox is open, just saying … thirst activated. (Although he’s little Reaver Butt in ASITE, which makes that weird, so maybe deactivated lol) I *loved* Reaver’s character in this though. I mean, I suspected I would, but he played a very present role throughout the story, which pleasantly surprised me! Plus, the humor between him and Kieran gave me life. (And hey, I’d still be down for Reaver/Kieran …) Reaver is the disaster child this series needed, and we deserved.\\n\\nThat said, Kieran has always been my favorite in this series (sorry Reaver, get in line), and my heart was singing every moment he was present in this book. I love the way his relationship with Poppy grew and seeing him singled out and given more focus in this installment is something I’ve been hoping we would get for awhile. We definitely could have gotten more, too. I was really touched by the way he and Poppy bonded over their shared grief while Cas was imprisoned, and it only served to show (IMO) just how much Cas (and his separation from them) means to both of them. My love for Kieran may cloud my judgment on some scenarios in the book, and I know others may have different feelings on this, which I’ll address in the spoilery part of my review.\\n\\nAnd TAWNY! I have missed Tawny so much. Without giving too much away, I was so glad to see her back in the story again. I have a Poppy level amount of questions when it comes to Tawny (I definitely think there is some stuff going on there and we’re going to be in for a surprise in future books) and am excited to see where her story goes.\\n\\nAlso: Malik! Malik! Malik! Okay, I did not expect to like Malik as much as I did, especially after TCOGB. He was one of the most compelling characters in this for me, and I’m so glad we finally got to spend some time around him. Especially after what happened with Ian in the last book. Also, seeing him interact with Cas and Kieran was intriguing, as this was a relationship we’d only ever been told about and had never seen. Considering his situation was a catalyst for so much of this story, I felt like a number of things came full circle with his storyline.\\nI connected with Millie’s unpredictable personality so much and can’t wait to learn more about her. In her IG live last week, JLA mentioned she has plans for a book about Millie and I internally screamed when I got that news, because she fascinates me. I loved the scene between her and Cas while he’s imprisoned. I definitely related to Cas’s WTF face. 😅\\nAlso, side note: Delano? Emil? Niall? I was STRESSED. And then I was not. Whew.\\n\\nOh, and am I the only one getting some daddy energy from Valyn? And not just because he’s Casteel and Malik’s father. Not that kind of daddy. 🤣\\n\\nThere are a few things I was meh about in this, and some of that is spoilery, so it’ll be included in that part, but I do think its fair to point out that Casteel’s character feels sidelined a bit at times. If you love PoppyCas, you might be disappointed in that alone (and that might compound thoughts on other parts of the book). However, I thought about this for a few days and realized … of course he feels like he’s sidelined. Casteel is not in a location to be present for the bulk of the action in this book, but he does have a regular recurring POV (which I loved, mind you), and we learn quite a bit in that POV. Was I disappointed that his character seemed sidelined? Sure. But looking at the structure of the story overall, it made sense. If there was an even balance between Poppy’s POV (where most of the action is occurring) and Casteel’s POV, I personally feel folks would see his chapters as dragging and slow (because it would create an imbalance in the pacing). In fact, lengthy separations are usually something I *hate* in a book (seriously, its an instant way to guarantee I’m going to want to nitpick every part of the book I dislike), but never once in this did I feel as though that separation was taking too long. I always felt as though Poppy, Kieran and crew were progressing toward rescuing Casteel and there’s enough of Casteel’s POV (and\\n) that I wasn’t missing him too much.\\n\\nI also believe there could be more explicit and clearer indications of relationship dynamics, but nothing relationship-wise in TWOTQ surprised me and I fully believe the writing has been on the wall since AKOFAF (and even the later chapters of the first book). I’ll dive more into that in the spoilery parts of my review, but I think seeing the foreshadowing in earlier books depends upon how folks read specific lines of dialogue and actions that simply put, WERE vague. From an authorial standpoint, it’s a double-edged sword. There’s this desire to not make things TOO obvious in one’s writing, while also trying to sprinkle in enough foreshadowing that a future point of the plot doesn’t seem like it’s come out of the woodwork. I do think this has suffered a little from that—and clearer foreshadowing seems to be something a lot of folks (who disliked the events of this book) wish they’d received. I don’t think the plot would have suffered had these things been clearer.\\n\\nDespite this, I am more than happy and satisfied with this book and where it takes the story. There has been so much focus on the romance aspect of this book (and the story overall), but there is far more to this book and series than that. TWOTQ was a great reminder that this is a fantasy series too. We get a good balance of fantasy action as well was more progress in the world building and progression of the larger Atlantia vs. Solis plot throughout TWOTQ.\\n\\nNext time though, more battle scenes, please. It is titled The War of Two Queens, after all.\\n\\nPlease note that these are JUST my opinions and I believe it is completely valid to dislike a book and give your honest (and hopefully respectful) opinions on why you disliked it. If you have not read the book and have gotten to this point, I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself with as little influence of other’s opinions as possible.\\n\\nThe place to find the most genuine reviews, from people who have actually purchased (and likely read) the book, is on Audible. You cannot review a book on Audible unless you’ve actually purchased it (whereas, you can review without purchasing on the regular Amazon listing for the other formats). So, again, if you feel conflicted on what to believe and aren’t sure if you want to read the book, I recommend checking out those reviews.\\n\\nThere are two SPOILERY reviews on Goodreads that I recommend reading, that have opposing viewpoints, that I feel did a great breakdown of the series and this book. Giving thoughtful and comprehensive comments on what they liked and disliked about the book.\\n\\nThe first, , breaks down the foreshadowing they saw in earlier books, that point to the events in this book. This is all the foreshadowing I felt was a clear indication for what happens in TWOTQ.\\n\\nThe second, discusses their disappointment over the events of the book in a thoughtful and respectful way. Yaz has been a pillar in the FBAA fandom since the beginning, and they take the time to mention that while they enjoyed the book overall, it fell flat for them in a few areas, and why.\\n\\nThese are fantastic reviews if you don’t mind spoilers, and I highly recommend reading both of them!\",\n",
       " \"Justice for every single PoppyCas lover out there!! You guys don't deserve this shitty ass book.\",\n",
       " 'WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS??? This isn’t even funny or cute. I am heartbroken 💔 I got the Kindle version. I REFUSE to buy the book. FUCK THAT.\\n\\nWhy, why, why did you take this route JLA. I get that you’re the author but where the fuck is the build up. Poppy & Kieran get close in a very toxic way because suddenly these two motherfuckers honestly forgot that Casteel is ENSLAVED AND BEING TORTURED. FUCK!\\n\\nRIP PoppyCas 2022 figuratively & literally\\nHeartmates my fucking ass.\\nKieran is reduce down to a Joining partner & nothing more\\n\\nWas it the bond b/t wolven that made Kieran suddenly have “feelings” for Poppy? Was it the fact that Casteel, your HEARTMATE, was gone that made you have these weak moments for Kieran? It’s like somehow Poppy & Kieran believed in having feelings for each other equals Casteel’s returned feelings and that’s not how that shit works. It’s not cute.\\n\\nGod forbid Casteel leaves again and Poppy develops feelings for someone else. 👀 Fucking cheater. I really do believe that Casteel was pushed to like this more so just to make Poppy happy. That doesn’t help him with his low self esteem of feeling unworthy of Poppy.\\n\\nCasteeeeeel! This book did not do you justice. My heart squeezes to point to pain. In TCOGB, Casteel explains multiple times how much Poppy means to him to point where it got annoying. We know that Poppy is Casteel’s everything. But I feel as though we don’t have that in return from Poppy. That’s heartbreaking.\\n\\nPoppy has the nerve to say all these things for Casteel: friend, betrayer, lover, heartmate, husband, king. My everything. So why the hell are you catching these intense feelings for Kieran? Having a heartmate, husband wasn’t enough so therefore she has this relationship with Kieran that’s more than a friend but less than a lover. That’s a disservice to Kieran.\\n\\nWhenever it’s asked “what are these feelings”? THE SHIT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. THATS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO CONFUSED.\\n\\nI was a fucking fool to believe there was a possibility that this unnecessary Joining wouldn’t happen. 🖕🏽🤡\\n\\n“The Joining doesn’t have to be sexual. It could happen or it couldn’t happen” I clung to this fucking quote for dear life. I thought that if it does happen maybe it won’t be sexual. Why the fuck would you tell us that REPEATEDLY? I felt like false hope was given out.\\n\\nDid Kieran really forget that Poppy is married to Casteel, his best friend???? Wtf is this man doing sharing a bed with her. Why was Kieran used as some kind of sex toy. Kieran is like Casteel where he doesn’t have a personality nor does he have a character arc. I WANTED MORE FOR KIERAN. Was it too much to fucking ask for that he gets his own love interest? I DO NOT want him with anyone else. KEEP HIS ASS WITH POPPY AND CASTEEL CAUSE LORD KNOWS HE DOESNT EXIST OUTSIDE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP.\\n\\nEven Tawny points that shit out:\\n\\n“So,” Tawny drew out the word. “Why is it that he behaves as I would expect from your husband?”\\n\\nAnd can Poppy stop petting the wolven like they’re some damn dogs 🙃 FUCK! A lot of people were worried that Poppy would be “over-powered” lmao JLA saw that and was like “fuck y’all, I’ll make her as powerful as I want”\\n\\nCasteel wants to pick and choose when to be protective. That shit is suffocating. Like, i can’t breathe. I thought he was losing his personality in TCOGB but SHIT it’s completely gone now right along with Kieran. If the roles were reversed, Casteel wouldn’t dare be with some other female. And Poppy insecure ass should know that.\\n\\nWOULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS “RELATIONSHIP”? This doesn’t make even fucking sense. Why on earth are their “feelings” involved???? I thought that I was fucking confused before. SHIT I don’t know what this relationship is now. Poppy can’t even explain this big mess. This was so unneeded. And the fact that it was dragged out until book 4 already let’s me know that JLA was dragging readers all along.\\n\\nAt first, I was really excited that this series was expanded from 4 to 6 books. But now, fuck can we get to the point already??? Plot, yeah that shit is non-existent. Unfortunately, this fandom is going to tear each other apart. FUCK!\\n\\nCasteel and Poppy are heartmates. That’s the strongest bond that a pair can have. Kieran is NOT part of this. Was it too much to ask that he gets his own person. Kieran, you don’t have a heartmate, nor a lover. Are you going to spend the rest of your life by their side? While they start a family, what will you do?\\n\\nAnd the thought of if Poppy goes down then Kieran & Casteel will go down WITH HER CRACKS MY FUCKING HEART. This is the main reason I never wanted the Joining. It’s like I’m holding my breathe. I have such a deep visceral reaction to that. 😩😩\\n\\nIt hurts deeply because is that how you see black/brown characters?? As some kind of sex toy and nothing more. It would’ve been bomb asf to have Kieran have a character arc. I know the Joining was the only thing he was made for and that shit hurts. I believed that JLA wouldn’t be the type of person to do fan service, FUCK! I was wrong. She catered to a portion of the fandom that didn’t even pay attention to the original plot or characters. She traded quality storyline for smut??? THAT WASNT EVEN FUCKING GOOD NOR CLEAR ENOUGH.\\n\\nPlease don’t ever in infinity & beyond put the blame on readers that they misinterpret the book. Everyone knows what the fuck they’re reading. And if THIS MANY readers are saying the same thing, it’s probably goes back to how it’s written. And fuck you for claiming that 🖕🏽🙂\\n\\nThis lady killed off 16 fucking drakens. TAKE THAT SHIT BACK!',\n",
       " \"DNF at 63%\\n\\nMan, I'm so disappointed. PoppyCas have been one of my favourite ships ever since I read FBAA. The fact that this book managed to ruin them for me says it all.\\n\\n**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**\\n\\nWhere to begin? At the end of TCOGB I was genuinely excited about TWOTQ because the narrative of a vengeful badass Poppy doing about anything to save Casteel was extremely promising - instead I got a repetitive, boring Poppy who keeps using her powers, awing everyone around her and feeling bad about it seconds later. Was it really that hard to try and go a little further in that department? Not to mention the fact that the vengeful badass Poppy was literally nowhere to be seen. All I got was Poppy ~kinda~ trying to save Casteel while playing house with Kieran.\\n\\nThe overall plot is a repeat of the last 2 books - same conflict, same dilemas, same solutions, same jokes... With the promise of a war this didn't exactly feel eventful.\\n\\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole PoppyKieran thing. I always knew the joining was a possibility but whatever the f*ck happened in this book went above and beyond f*cked up. Seriously? Why create unnecessary sexual tension between two characters who should be worried about the fact their husband and best friend is literally locked away in a cell, lying in his own flith, starving and being tortured? I had more content about Poppy and Kieran holding hands than I had POV's from Casteel. It was like JLA was deadset on making us forget Poppy is married to Casteel and not to Kieran.\\n\\nAnd these characters? I've loved Casteel, Poppy and Kieran from day one but whoever the hell was in this book was not them. Their decisions, their manners, their RELATIONSHIPS, everything felt off and weird to the point it made me nauseous. I genuinely don't know what happened in this book but I hardly see myself pick up the rest of the series after this absolute sh*t show.\\n\\nJLA really managed to ruin an entire series in a single book because she was more interested in a threesome than in the actual development of the characters and the plot. Will forever be bitter about this bs.\",\n",

Daughter of the Moon Goddess pretty much opens almost straight onto a chase scene, with Xingyin fleeing the only home she has ever known to hide her existence from the Celestial Emperor who imprisoned her mother on the moon. So it's quite exciting from the get-go.\\n\\nThrough a combination of chance and quick-wittedness, Xingyin moves from being a servant to a student to a soldier. A bond forms between her and her study partner, none other than the emperor's son, but he has a duty to his kingdom and they can never be anything more than friends with lusty glances.\\n\\nI found the mythology fascinating, as I did all the questing. Mostly, I think, because Xingyin's motives to finally free her mother were an emotionally-engaging and worthy cause. The stakes seemed high, especially if Xingyin should be discovered before she'd proved herself to the emperor.\\n\\nThere is a love triangle, if that's something that bothers you, but I found it realistic and felt that it made sense within the context of this story. Plus it adds some delicious tension that I, frankly, couldn't get enough of!\\n\\nThe only thing I wonder is if the author will be able to sustain the excitement through the second book now certain aspects key to this installment seem resolved. If the second book is all about winning wars, I'm not sure I'll like it the same.\",\n",

       " '2/5\\n\\nWhy can’t I have my anticipated releases ever be five starts unless they’re from authors I already love? We shall never know. I am so so so sad I didn’t like this book but if a book could bore me to death it would be this one. It’s pitched as a feminist retelling of the Chinese myth of Chang’e , the moon goddess. Chang’e herself is barely in this book and she really does nothing of any relevance whatsoever besides drinking the elixir of immortality. With a title so centric to her and of course ever daughter, I’d think their bond would be a central point but it was really only relevant at the beginning and end.\\n\\nXingyin is our main character, and I despise her. For a not even fifteen year old at the beginning, her narration is the exact same throughout the entire boo, showing no growth, development, or even aging. She talks and thinks the same way for years and then wonders why things go wrong for her! Except nothing goes wrong. She masters archery in mere months (just because her father is an excellent archer does not mean she should be able to magically be amazing at it as well), can fight in battles after being severely poisoned and injured like it’s nothing, somehow make two men fall in love with her, and do impossible tasks suit him 2 chapters of the book.\\nHer character has such a lack of personality and growth it’s hard to believe how everyone can like her so much, and it’s hard to agree with anything she says. The dialogue of this book is so unnatural. It fits in with the beautiful writing but the fact is no one actually speaks in fluent sentences like that. Seriously. Love confessions and denials are never spoken how they are in this book, it was all so formal- every character spoke to each other the same way they spoke to the emperor. What?\\n\\nLiwei is our first love interest, the Emperor’s son. He’s boring. He’s supposed to be the sweeter love interest I suppose, but he has, again, such lack of growth I don’t see it. Anytime another guy, just some other guy the same age as him talks to Xingyin, he gets all jealous and cold. The amount of times he would get cold with Xingyin because she spoke to another guy was ridiculous.\\nThen we have Wenzhi, the captain of the guard. He’s the more mysterious love interest but acts the same way as Liwei- getting jealous when Xingyin gets attention, never developing, and overall lacking in any personality.\\n\\nThe plot? Forget it. It was all over the place with time jumps and random sub plots that held no relevance whatsoever to freeing Chang’e. Halfway through and I had no clue what the main plot even was (spoilers below). First there’s a competition to be Liwei’s companion, Xingyin wins. Then we have a time jump, she learns he’s betrothed (which always happens with royals), she gets mad, and leaves to become part of the army. The army goes to defeat creatures, we have a whole sequence defeating the mer people. Then, oh no, Liwei’s betrothed is kidnapped, some flower goddess wanted revenge on the empress, but that’s not the end! We finally get to the plot where Xingyin had a quest to free her mother, she must obtain 4 dragon pearls. She does so in two chapters. Not even. Then we have a dramatic plot twist where Wenzhi is actually prince of the demon realm (a place never really spoken of directly besides it’s bad) , and wants some power? But who even cares because Xingyin escapes from the realm and the book ends with her mom free and all is happy. That’s an awfully slow plot. Nothing happens. It’s so much that’s happening that it feels like nothing has any importance.\\n\\nThe romance was terrible. No development is made between either relationship. Xingyin walks away or is silent anytime either of the love interests talks to her about it. She kisses them, says she loves one, and then the next morning promises to live her life out with the other one! What?????\\n\\nAnd at the end of the day the only redeeming factor is the writing. It’s very beautiful. But nothing can redeem the book itself for being poorly executed.\\n\\nAnyways here’s to another book that let me down. 😕',\n",

       " '2 stars✨ this was my most anticipated 2022 read...\\n\\nNo way this is an adult book when it reads like a children’s book😭\\n\\nThe writing style is all surface level. There is no depth to anything. It\\'s crazy how this book has a love triangle and there was not a single moment building up to EITHER love interests. It just ✨happens✨ The dialogues are mostly informative. There is no teasing or bickering. I don\\'t understand how the author expects us to believe the when we have nothing to go off of besides the MC telling us lines like \"our ill-fated love\" PLEASE. EVERY CONVERSATION YOU HAVE IS BLAND. ALL YOU DO IS EXCHANGE INFORMATION.\\n\\nThere is to anything, actually. No inkling that she is afraid of taking a life, only after she slays monsters we get an \"i\\'m sad\" or \"i\\'m crying\" sentence. Okay gurl I wish I could be sad with you but I literally did not know this mattered to you until this very moment and it never gets addressed again🤨\\n\\nThere is no tense moments, it is bland all the way through. It was 300 pages of filler before something finally started to pick up, and even then it was nothing special. Everything in this book is all bark, no bite. The danger that threatens the kingdom? Mediocre. Her perilous quest? Mediocre. Fight scenes? Mediocre. They have a dangerous creature to take down and the captain tells them the plan AT THE DOORSTEP OF THEIR ENEMY??\\n\\nThis book keeps describing flowers and lanterns, how about describing training and fight scenes instead of skipping over them PLEASE. That\\'s literally the best part of a book. How am I supposed to care for our MC\\'s journey if we don\\'t get to go through the struggles with her? Every single moment is sped up, glossed over. \"we fight terrifying monsters, ravenous beasts —\" OKAY SO SHOW US😭😭 Why are we skipping over the good stuff and instead have to read filler after filler?\\n\\nThe fell flat. BOTH love interests as well, absolutely NOTHING romantic happens between them. And when they kiss? Okay damn, I didn\\'t know you liked her until then. That\\'s the problem. It\\'s awkward... so terribly awkward.\\n\\nThe Everyone sounds the same. You\\'re telling me servants, Imperial Majesties, and ancient dragons sound the same? Some even sound cringe because they are trying so hard to be threatening but the word choices... it\\'s like kids fighting on a playground... aren\\'t you supposed to be hundreds of years old?\\n\\nThe fight scenes... tell me why, WHY she is able to be struck by dangerous, paralyzing venom and still fight? Or have a sword impaling her shoulder and she is fine in the next sentence. It is so inconsistent with what is happening. Just like her feelings.\\n\\nThis is the second book where I went \"how many more pages left?\" because it was so frustrating to read.',\n",
       " 'Thank you to Netgalley for providing me an ARC!\\n\\nAh yes, yet another ARC I read after it was released. In my defense, I did actually start it before it came out.\\n\\nI was so freaking excited about this book when I found out about it. First of all, Chang’e is one of my favorite Chinese myths (out of the admittedly small number that I know). Second of all, a female warrior protagonist? And an Ancient Chinese fantasy aesthetic setting? Yes.\\n\\nIn reality, I was\\n\\nI was expecting something so immersive and exciting, and while this book started out that way, it didn’t last and it wasn’t strong enough for me to really get that experience.\\n\\nThe follows Xingyin, the daughter of Chang’e, the Moon Goddess. Her mother has been imprisoned by the Celestial Emperor for becoming an immortal, and when the Celestial Army threatens her mother, Xingyin is forced to flee from the palace of the moon.\\n\\nShe lands herself - quite literally - in enemy territory, falling into the Celestial Kingdom itself. She earns a position as the Crown Prince Liwei’s companion, training alongside him in all things. From there, she struggles to find a path back to her mother while navigating the romance between herself and the Prince.\\n\\nI was honestly expecting more from the storyline. I wanted something more action-packed, more intense. I wanted to feel more emotions about the events of the book. But I just couldn’t.\\n\\nToo many things in the story were just too obviously rigged. It felt like they were there to keep things going without much real intrigue. There were so many time skips where Xingyin just says something like, “The next two years I spent by his side”, or, “I spent my time training and the months flew by.” I don’t want detailed depictions of every day, but this felt too much like the author trying to get to specific parts of the plot with minimal effort.\\n\\nThe part where Xingyin enters the competition to become Liwei’s companion should have been so much more tense. A competition that, according to Xingyin, could change the course of her life - but it only took up a few pages?\\n\\nThe events of the competition were so quick and way too easy that it was almost laughable. It was set up for Xingyin to win from the beginning, and that took away any excitement I as a reader had about that scene.\\n\\n\\n\\nHonestly, my main issue was Her decisions were what got her into this mess. I can understand her going into a ~rebellious teenager~ phase, but this one random instance just once again felt set up in order to advance the plot.\\n\\nHalf of her problems were caused by her own stupid decisions. But technically she doesn’t because she could have just left at that point if she wanted to, and she only stayed out of a sense of obligation and because she was ~in love.~\\n\\nShe as a character was very compelling, but her narrative wasn’t that exciting. I really enjoyed her development, and I loved the way she grew as a person through the book, but I didn’t feel a strong connection with her and therefore wasn’t as invested in her perspective.\\n\\nI liked that she was stubborn, and ambitious, and held herself to a high standard, but I feel like she as a person could have been developed so much more. I was fully prepared to enjoy her character and didn’t get to do that as much as I wanted to.\\n\\n\\n\\nwas an interesting character, but I liked him a lot better when he was first introduced compared to him later on. It felt like, instead of getting more fleshed out as Xingyin got to know him, he just gradually became more and more bland compared to his first impression.\\n\\nHonestly, he felt like a lot of other characters in a lot of other books. He was the Crown Prince who wasn’t interested in his responsibilities or betrothal arrangements, and all he wanted to do was paint and spend time training, but when it really came down to it he was invested in the good of his kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\nwas very interesting but felt a little bit cliché as well. He was the famous army man who was known for his skill and had a distaste for the court he served. He was tough but understanding and had a very mentor vibe to him but then had a hidden romantic side. I thought he was interesting when he was introduced, being a powerful captain and seeming important to the story, but I stopped really paying attention after a few chapters.\\n\\nThe was okay, but it just didn’t feel interesting. Xingyin and Liwei got along well and their banter was fine, but there wasn’t any of the “passionate romance” that the synopsis was promising.\\n\\nAlso, the love triangle that developed about 40% into the book was completely unnecessary. It added nothing to the plot except for obliviousness on Xingyin’s part ().\\n\\nOh wait, I do know what this added. A healthy dose of not-like-other-girls™ to Xingyin’s character. I was not here for the narrative.\\n\\nXingyin was fine at first, but she gradually just became this stereotypical heroine. For example:\\n\\n\\n\\nWow she’s so strong and gifted, it doesn’t matter that she’s not pretty because she can do archery! And archery comes naturally to her!\\n\\nHonestly, a lot of this book just felt the same as other books I’ve read. The first-impression scene where Xingyin meets Liwei? They have an ~honest conversation™~ because he “just wants honest companionship” and “a break from court” and she doesn’t recognize him until someone calls him by his title. It was honestly the same as so many other stories that I’ve read and none of it felt special pertaining to either of the characters. I don’t see the appeal of this cliché anymore.\\n\\nWhat really saved this book for me was the\\n\\nThe writing came across really nicely, and I liked the lyrical quality there was to the words. I’m a sucker for fantasy writing, and while this wasn’t the most flowery, gorgeous writing in existence, it really didn’t have to be. It melded with the story well and got across without an overuse of metaphors.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe setting was beautiful, because I love ancient-Chinese mythology and I love the way mythological Asian settings come across. The intricacies of the world-building and descriptions of the environment were just so enjoyable.\\n\\nthis book could have been so much better than it was for me. Maybe I just went in with too-high expectations, but can you really blame me?\\n\\nBut still. I really wanted this to be more powerful, intense and immersive, and it just didn’t get there for me. It started out really strong and exciting, and something about it declined as I went.\\n\\nI enjoyed this book a lot, despite how salty I sound about it. It was beautiful and I liked the narrative, and while it wasn’t my favorite book ever, it was still a good one. I would absolutely recommend it. It just fell short of the hype for me.',\n",
       " \"Now a Goodreads Choice Finalist in Fantasy and Debut Novel!!\\n\\nWhen I first saw this cover and went to post about my excitement for Daughter of the Moon Goddess, I wrote that I was sure this was going to be “an incredible fantasy epic”. And that was exactly the right word: epic. Like a classic narrative epic poem, Sue Lynn Tan recounts the story of Xingyin, daughter of banished immortal Chang'e, and her quest to free her mother and herself from their eternal confinement.\\n\\nFrom the moment Xingyin escapes the moon on a cloud (yes, really), there’s feeling of immensity to her story. And as we follow her down the path of self-discovery, I couldn’t help but match up each stage of her tale with the traditional Hero’s Journey—a la Joseph Campbell. From the three “acts”: Departure, Initiation (& Descent), and Return; to specific elements like ‘supernatural aid’ and ‘apotheosis’ (raising a mortal to a god-like level), Xingyin more than rivals classic Homeric heroes such as Odysseus and Achilles. She endeavors to staggering heights and perilous depths, and is at her strongest when she’s acting on the behalf of those she loves.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in Xingyin’s quiet moments, we get to feel a number of dueling loyalties play out. Will she stay behind with the first boy in the Celestial Kingdom to show her true kindness, or will she follow the one who can help her achieve what she��s always wanted to be? Is Xingyin willing to sacrifice her own chance at happiness for a way to free her mother? Exactly how far is she willing to go in order to accomplish some of these goals?\\n\\nIt would be reductive to say any of these questions fall into the expected fan-service style tropes. These motivations come so naturally to the character, and by extension the audience. Every bit of longing feels real and every betrayal fully stings. To read is to become Xingyin, her strengths, flaws and internal discord all included.\\n\\nEvery word of this over five hundred page novel is thoughtfully chosen, crafted with the utmost care. It’s poetic without being overly flowery, and never light on plot or action. While there’s many stages of the journey Xingyin goes on, it all feels like a natural extension—one story bleeding into the next. I’ve seen a few reviews mention how full this book is, that it could almost be split into two, but I think that would have been a mistake. ends exactly where it should, with Xingyin completing this arc and preparing for whatever unknown is to come. And I can’t wait to embark with her on that one as well.\",\n",

       " \"All the stars and the moon.\\n\\nThis novel was wish fulfilment, you guys. Seriously, it was all my smol Chinese heart could have wanted and more. And I loved it. I loved how it delved deep into a well of Chinese mythology and culture. I loved how authentically rendered it was, stirring an ache within me−a longing for a world of immortal beings, whimsical deities and glowing, mythical beasts, of blossom fields and full moon nights melding together.\\n\\n\\n\\nwas the perfect novel for me (yes, I'm very whipped for it). I'd not fault it for anything, although fair criticism has been directed at its plot, or rather, how repetitive it was. And repetition is a trait that has traditionally typified Chinese high fantasy stories, particularly in . But at the same time I can argue that this repetitivity is what grows and nourishes the story, shaping it into something meaningful, that it is to the story as repeating beats are to the heart.\\n\\nI'd love to write more about how perfect this novel was for Chinese-drama-loving me, but that'd be a rather futile pursuit, I feel. All I can say is that if you're a fan of this is the story for you.\\n\\n5.0/5\",\n",

       " 'Why I chose to read this book:\\n1. I saw this book featured recently on Goodreads, and because I enjoy fantasy inspired by myths, legends and folktales from various cultures (in this case, Chinese), I decided to sign out a copy from my local library; and,\\n2. April 2022 my self-declared \"Fantasy and Science Fiction Month\"!\\n\\n\\n1. I liked how the Chinese legends about Chang\\'e, the moon goddess and her mythological Chinese archer husband, Hou Yi, as well as the four dragons that represent China\\'s four largest rivers, were incorporated in this story;\\n2. plot - the beginning starts off with a bang! I really enjoyed the escapades and battle scenes that MC Xingyin was a part of as an archer in the Celestial Army;\\n3. includes a map of the Mortal and Immortal Realms (helpful!);\\n4. details - Oh wow! The descriptions of various settings, fashions, architecture and artifacts were astounding! My visual and tactile senses came alive!\\n\\n\\n1. I\\'m not a fan of the romance genre, and this book was a little romance-heavy. I\\'d be okay with that, except it\\'s not very believable and a little boring. Even though there\\'s the typical \"love triangle\", I felt that Xingyin and her \"guys\", Liwei and Wenshi, treated each other more like formal friends rather than love interests (not warm at all);\\n2. as stated above, I love a descriptive story, but sometimes author went overboard. Unless they\\'re unusually distinctive, don\\'t use the word \"orbs\" for \"eyes\" (lose the thesaurus!). Also, Tan would use certain color words, like , and ad nauseam! Speaking of which, Tan had Xingyin sick to her stomach (gagging, retching, nauseated, roiled, choking down her bile, churning - just to name a few). My \"orbs\" were frequently rolling every time this was mentioned!;\\n3. I had to laugh at some of the challenges Xingyin and other competitors had to \"endure\" to earn a place as a fellow companion for Crown Prince Liwei, like (get this) ! Seriously? What was this? A MasterChef competition? Too bad Gord Ramsay wasn\\'t a judge, because he would have spewed Xingyin\\'s tea all over the place, and would have been funny!;\\n4. The \"Sky Drop Tassels\" Liwei and Xingyin exchange to warn one if the other was in danger seemed pointless, as one wouldn\\'t know of the other\\'s dilemma until it was almost too late; and,\\n5. in my opinion, my biggest complaint is the shortfall of character development. Besides the absence of a true love story, I was unhappy with the lack of growth in Xingyin\\'s character. From beginning to end, she comes off as impulsive. I was hoping that she would grow as a kickass First Archer like Legolas in or Katniss in . Instead, she often seems unsure of her abilities, and at times, wasn\\'t that adept. The author has her recovering from various injuries that easily killed off other soldiers. I don\\'t think any of this book\\'s characters will be memorable.\\n\\nOverall, I give this book 3 stars, because it did have some good points and a gorgeous cover, but I probably won\\'t be reading the next book in this duology, .',\n",
       " 'Fantastic story! I\\'m rarely caught by surprise by plot twists because normally I can see the foreshadowing from afar, especially if it\\'s a retelling or inspired by mythology. Nonetheless, \"Daughter of the Moon Goddess\" managed to surprise me. There was one Big Twist I didn\\'t see coming, and so was mad at, but in a good way because I\\'m like that, I celebrate when an author cleverly fools me and catches me off guard. Bow to Sue Lynn Tan for pulling it off.\\n\\nI am a declared hater of love triangles. Mostly because I detest them on principle and for the drama & angst they bring to the story, but also because in the quite rare cases I\\'ve been able to tolerate triangles for the sake of the plot, the chosen lucky bastard is usually not the one I favour for the main lead to end up with. I was made to suffer for my preference of character in this book, but fortunately not everything was killed in the bud, and I\\'m so looking forward to what is to come. No, I can\\'t name which character I\\'m favouring, as it\\'d be a huge spoiler, but once you read the book, you\\'ll easily see who it is.\\n\\nThe worldbuilding of this book is credible without being overdone or underdone, no complications and excessive descriptions. It\\'s mostly at court, but with incursions around so you can be shown the world the Immortals inhabit. If you know nothing about Chinese mythology, you\\'ll still both understand and identify the references because it all trickles in at correct doses for you to get an idea about how things work in the universe of Chinese immortals. I am not familiar with their folklore beyond knowing Chang\\'e was the Chinese goddess of the Moon, but at no point did I feel lost or confuses. It\\'s easy and readable.\\n\\nI\\'m also pleased with the fact that, for once, it\\'s the character that is the Good Boy whilst the female lead is . . . well, complicated. But lovable. Does this mean the era of hot jerks that dominate Fantasy and YA is coming to a close and we\\'ll be seeing more and more upright, good boys (but still hot)? Still, I am also pleased by the prospect of seeing a properly done redemption arc in the next book for a certain someone.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s no way that this is a debut. I\\'m having such a hard time believing that. I\\'m not the biggest fantasy reader, but when I say that this is one hell of fantasy book I mean that with every fiber in my body. Tan did such an excellent job with this story that I can\\'t wait for the second book in the duology.\\n\\nI didn\\'t necessarily know much about Daughter of the Moon Goddess before reading it. I knew that it was getting a lot of buzz and that most readers were enjoying it; however, it wasn\\'t one that was high on my radar. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. Based on the legend of Chang\\'e and ancient Chinese mythology, this novel follows Xingyin as she is forced to leave the moon once she finds out that her mere existence and powers are a danger to her mother. Eventually, she finds her way to the Celestial Kingdom where she must hide her identity to survive. She not only befriends the prince of the kingdom, but becomes his aide of sorts. Eventually she joins the military where she embarks on dangerous journeys in attempt to save her mother.\\n\\nI don\\'t even know where to begin in my praises of this novel. It\\'s definitely well-written and accessible which makes it a good fit for those who are looking to transition from YA fantasy to adult fantasy. I know that Tan describes this as a sort of a \"in-between\" novel when it comes to target audience and I definitely can understand how it could be targeted at an upper YA audience and an adult audience. One thing that this book made me realize is that I really enjoy fantasy novels that include some form of political intrigue. It inevitable means that someone isn\\'t who they say they are and betrayal is a guarantee. Tan used the politics of the world to not only shape the plot, but also her characters leading to one of the craziest plot twists that I\\'ve read in a fantasy in a while. This crazy political intrigue also led to some intense and interesting battles with mythical creatures (including mer people, dragons, and more). Combined with elemental magic, these scenes were some of my favorite parts of the book. It is clear from the beginning that this is an expansive world and there is potential for readers to see more of that in the second book.\\n\\nTan is not only a gifted writer, but also a pro at character development. Xingyin is easy to root as a reader. I appreciated that every move she made was to put herself into a better position to help her mother. While we don\\'t necessarily get to see a lot of their relationship on page, those small moments were so beautiful. Additionally, the other main characters were extremely interesting. While I can\\'t reveal too much about them, I will say that it is interesting to watch the ways that they change throughout the course of the novel. Tan also introduces a love triangle in this book, BUT it\\'s a love triangle done right. The fall out that comes from it is EPIC and I don\\'t feel like it happened just for the sake of happening. It was a necessary move and it made sense in the context of the story. Also, there is a lovers to enemies trope in this novel that was \"chefs kiss.\" I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever seen it done before and my goodness I LOVED it.\\n\\nIf it isn\\'t clear from the context of this review, I absolutely loved this book. I will say that the writing style may not work for everyone as Tan is extremely descriptive, but I think it works well for the world building. Definitely one of my top books of 2022.',\n",

I pushed through it as much as I could just because it was a book that I've been looking forward to for so long.

It is almost entirely filler chapters. started out with a bang, immediately catapulting readers into the world. For the first couple of chapters, I was obsessed and could not put this book down. But as the book progressed, I found myself caring less and less about anything that happened. Liwei and Xingyin had zero chemistry. There was nothing that could have possibly indicated romance between them, other than very obvious hints torward it. I had no idea that there was a love triangle in this book either. Captain Wenzhi was slightly more compelling than Liwei, and I stuck around just in hopes of him and Xingyin having some good scenes together. But, still, I just did not care about them or their relationships at all.\\n\\nSome of the things I did enjoy about this book were the prose and the worldbuilding.

The writing captivated me immediately, and it seemed only natural to ease into such a rich and colourful world.

       " \"In a Nutshell: Loved the plot. Loved the Fantasy world and everything out-worldly. Liked the characters. Hated the writing style.\\n\\nStory:\\nInspired by the Chinese legend of the moon goddess, this story tells of a young girl Xingyin accustomed to living alone on the moon with her mother Chang’e. What she doesn’t know is that Chang’e has been exiled for stealing the elixir of immortality from the Celestial Emperor. Due to her presence coming to light, Xingyin is forced to escape from the moon and somehow lands up in the Celestial Kingdom, working as a maid for a local wealthy family. When there’s an opportunity to train alongside Crown Prince Liwei, she grabs at it, not knowing that her life will change from that moment. What follows is an interesting story of secrets and scandals, battles with strange and scary monsters, and even forbidden romantic entanglements.\\nThe story comes to us in the first person perspective of Xingyin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n😍 The book has a distinctly episodic feel to it. Each segment of the story can be compartmentalised, and each has its own appeal. Some segments work better than others, but most were pretty good. I enjoyed the action sequences most of all, what with dragons and mind magic and octopuses and what not, each fight sequence was astounding to read.\\n\\n😍 The author’s world building is exquisite. The story had a genuine feel of a Chinese legend, even though it is only partially based on Chang’e’s story. The Celestial Kingdom, the various creatures, the magical weaponry, everything was enjoyable.\\n\\n😍 The characters are going to leave their marks on your mind, though you may not like them all. Xingyin is outspoken, impetuous and rude. She thinks only about herself and hardly ever learns from her mistakes. As such, she makes for quite an irritating protagonist. I suppose it’s a YA thing because many YA books seem to have such unlikeable leading characters. It works for the story, and that’s the most important thing. The two male leads have decently-sketched characters too, though both go through drastic behavioural changes as the story proceeds. Nevertheless, the characters shoulder the story well.\\n\\n😍 The female representation in the story is amazing. I loved how many of the soldiers in the Celestial army and other key characters were women and the plot uses them well. This is unlike usual legendary fantasies.\\n\\n😍 While there are the usual Fantasy-Romance tropes such as romantic triangles and an all-surviving MC who always wins despite the odds, they are handled pretty well and don't feel boring.\\n\\n😍 The book is volume one of an intended duology, but it has no cliffhanger ending. The story sets the foundation well for whatever is to come and at the same time, satisfies its readers with proper closure.\\n\\n\\n\\n😒 The only but biggest factor against the book: its writing style. God, how I hated it! As it comes to us from Xingyin‘s 1st person pov, I expected a certain amount of rambling, What I didn’t expect was for almost every paragraph to contain at least 3-4 sentences on her personal thoughts, even in between dialogues. This inner monologue became so irritating after a while. A typical scene in the book would be as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is even worse in audio because you feel like you are listening to the most egotistical person on earth who wants to talk about EVERY SINGLE DAMN EMOTION!!!!\\n\\nThere are also too many similes and metaphors. While many of them were apt and beautiful, it was an overkill. All this adds too much of clutter to the proceedings. The story would have worked even better had it been crisper by chopping out such needless flourishes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe audiobook, clocking at 15 hours, is narrated by Natalie Naudus. I appreciate the decision to take an Asian-American narrator for the story. She performs remarkably, and her voices and her emotions are good. The problem was, her accent is strongly American. While I am okay with this usually, the word that bugged me the most was her pronunciation of “duty” as “doody”. I understand this is quite common in some American accents, but it was very distracting to my ears! Thus, in a book where Liwei was constantly struggling with his “doody”, I just ended up rolling my eyes multiple times.\\n\\n\\nI was pretty torn over my rating for this one because I loved the story so much and I hated the writing style almost equally. But what it boils down to is this: do I want to read the second part of this duology? Turns out, in spite of all my complaints, I do, eagerly! And that tilted the balance in favour.\\n\\n4 stars from me. (5 stars for the plot, world-building, fantastical elements and action sequences. 3 stars for the character sketching. 2 stars for the writing style.)\\n\\n\\nMy thanks to HarperCollins UK Audio and NetGalley for the ALC of “Daughter of the Moon Goddess”.

       " \"Nothing like starting off the new year with a very anticipated read and.. well, not hating it, but this took a lot of willpower to push through over the course of the first few days of 2022 and honestly, with the exception of one plot point, I did not enjoy.. any of this?\\n\\nThis is a long book, see above page count, however the problem was it also felt long. The beginning especially seems to go on forever with very little happening and also a very strange sense of time passage within the story itself. And considering how things started, and all the urgency that kicks off the story, well.. it dissipated as quickly as my New Year diet resolutions.\\n\\nAnd I think overall that's my issue with the whole story. The sense of forward motion, of urgency, of our main character's dedication to saving her mother totally vanishes into the mundane doldrums of a whole other different story. And it's only near the end that she suddenly seems to phase back into that main concern. Yes, she was working towards a thing that she maybe could use to her advantage but.. I don't know. This felt like three different books in one and not in a good way.\\n\\nAs for the romance, well. I appreciated what the author tried to do with this love triangle, which was a more mature way of handling the usual YA fallback, however, at the same time, it didn't work for me. And I worry about what awaits us in book two in that regard. Though.. I don't think I'll be reading it.\\n\\nNormally I'm full of second (third, fourth, fifth..) chances for authors, particularly debuts, but nothing in this writing was passionate. Or compelling. Or enthralling. It was lovely at times but honestly it was pretty dry. Again, where was the urgency, the tension, the stakes, and, yes, the passion. Hell, emotion of any kind. I felt nothing, no matter how hard I tried. Sadly this read likely tripled my screentime for the month because I kept putting it down.. which, yeah, added to the time it took me to finish but goodness I took any excuse to look away.\\n\\nAgain, this is a huge disappointment as I fell in love with this cover months ago and thought it sounded utterly captivating and unique. But for me? It wasn't it. As always, of course, don't just take my word for it; I highly encourage you to check out other reviews as this low rating is but a drop in the current rave review ocean.\\n\\n** I received an ARC from the publisher (thank you!) in exchange for an honest review. **\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis review can also be found at .\",\n",

It’s been six long years since I wrote this ridiculous post that turned into a timeline of US history somewhat. Now, it’s time to give my actual review of the book. To the people that actually take the time to read this portion, thanks lol. To those who only saw the funny ramblings, that’s cool too.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinor spoilers below! Major spoilers will be hidden!\\n\\nSet six years after the events of The Bands of Mourning, Wax is now more politician than lawman. Wayne is an actual constable now and Marasi’s partner. They’ve all had changes in their personal lives. Wax and Steris now have two kids, Max and Tindwyl. Marasi has been dating Allik for a couple of years. And Wayne, unfortunately, is feeling a bit down on account of the fact that MeLaan said she’s going to break up with him soon. Still, there is the problem of the Set and Trell looming over their heads. After a few years of quiet, Marasi now has a solid lead on what they’ve been doing this whole time and a way to catch them. She and Wayne travel to Bilming in the hopes of surprising one of the Set’s smuggling operations. What they discover is so much more than that and Wax is once again called to be Harmony’s sword as he joins them.\\n\\nI have waited for this book for so damn long. I’m not even sure if I had any expectations for this. I just knew I was going to love it, and I did. There were gunfights and explosions and some of the most extraordinary usage of Allomancy I’ve seen since Mistborn. Wax and Wayne can still kick plenty if ass even if they are older now. New technology is coming and the world is getting more and more dangerous. Wax accidentally creates what is essentially a nuclear bomb and realizes the Set must have too and will use it to destroy Elendel, and he must do whatever it takes to stop it with Wayne’s help. After all of these years, he will once again come face to face with his sister. Except this time, he knows only one of them can live.\\n\\nMarasi is on her own mini quest. Approached by a secret society who seeks to recruit her, she uncovers something that is equally, if not more, sinister than a bomb to blow up an entire city. We meet several characters who are not of this world and they show her glimpses into the secrets of the Cosmere. They are unique, but also dangerous.\\nI am happy with how much Marasi has grown. She is no longer within Wax’s shadow and is more or less in charge of Wayne lol. At the very least she keeps him from going too off the rails. She’s happy with her job s a detective, but still yearns to do more, without compromising her morals. I would say she accomplishes that, and then some in this finale. The fact that she chooses to pass on said secret society so she can stay and make the world better in a more tangible, honest way, is true to her character.\\n\\nWe get plenty of introspection from the others as well. Wax still struggles with his identity and place in life. Does he have control over his own life or has he always been led by Harmony? Can he be father, and politician, and lawman all in one? Is it possible to balance all of that? Steris is coming into her own as well and her perpetual preparedness comes in real handy back in Elendel. She wrangles the governor, and is in charge of evacuations when things are clearly going south. She’s not just Wax’s wife, but someone who has her own talent and is damn good at it. The fact that she breaks out of her anxious shell to do all of this makes it even better. Wayne is struggling. He’s filthy rich after accidentally making some good investments lol, one of which is turning noseball (AKA baseball) into a sport. But he’s struggling with his own idea of self-worth, especially since MeLaan has decided to end things and literally leave for space. He’s still unable to forgive himself for his past and is in a dark place during most of the book. The way he talked about himself hurt my heart since he’s my fave. He has a hard time believing he’s a hero too. Harmony himself seems to be going through some things. It’s very reminiscent to how Preservation was slowly deteriorating in Mistborn: Secret History. I am very worried for Sazed and what will come in the new era.\\n\\nThis book also brought me great pain, like I knew it would. Going into this I knew someone had to die. They had gotten off too easy in the previous books. Someone I loved had to die and I thought I was prepared for it. Turns out I wasn’t.\\nAnd I cried like a baby. A huge part of me hates it. I will always hate it because he deserved better. He deserved to live his life completely and maybe find someone else and he happy with them.\\nI don’t think I’m going to get over this any time soon.\\n\\nI’m sad to see this era go. When I first started this I was kinda disappointed that I wouldn’t get any of my faves, but I love these characters so much now. From Wax and Wayne’s partnership to Wax and Steris’ romance. Wayne and MeLaan’s banter and eventual romance (who I missed terribly in the book). Marasi finding love with Allik and coming into her own as a woman. They all did some amazing growth in here. A lot of which was forgiving themselves for their pasts and allowing themselves to move on for the sake of their loved ones. I’m going to miss everyone, truly. Wayne especially. Their dynamic was something else.\\n\\nI hope I don’t have to wait another six years for Era Three lol. I don’t think I can handle another wait that long. If it comes to that I think I’ll cry and write another unhinged time capsule of the sad state of this country lmao. If you’ve made it this far, below you will find a lot of my favorite quotes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nway\",\n",
       " \"ARC provided by the publisher—Gollancz—in exchange for an honest review.\\n\\nMy god... The Lost Metal was an explosive and stunning conclusion to Mistborn: Wax and Wayne series. Sanderson has delivered another tremendous finishing volume in The Mistborn Saga, reinforcing my excitement for future Cosmere books.\\n\\nI honestly have no idea where to begin here. was my most anticipated books of 2022. But personally, this book release goes beyond that for me. Many of you most likely know already that the first was the series that made me fall in love with reading fantasy novels. On top of that, it felt surreal to be finished reading . For the past six years, the three books sitting the longest on my TBR pile have always been by Scott Lynch, then by Patrick Rothfuss, and by Brandon Sanderson. Yes, against all odds, one of these books that felt like myths have finally been released and read by me. My expectations were understandably so high. I am fully caught up with every Cosmere novel and title. I even did a full reread of the entire , starting from up to , in preparation for . And Brandon Sanderson, once again and to no surprise, exceeded my expectations in many ways with . He proved himself, again, why he continues to become one of my favorite authors of all time.\\n\\nWriting a spoiler-free review for is not an easy task, to say the least, for me. Sanderson has mentioned for a while now that will be THE book in the entire Cosmere (so far) that features the biggest Cosmere crossovers and connections yet. And he's not joking about this. Even the main plot in involves characters and beings from other worlds and series beyond Scadrial, the world where take place. This review will be as spoiler-free as possible, but I will mention a few terms and organizations from other series here. This is unavoidable. We're almost halfway through the Cosmere timelines so far. Sanderson and his grand vision can't wait for readers to catch up to reading his books. And to be fair, it has been sixteen years since was first released. No spoiler for in this review, but I sincerely hope you're familiar with the Cosmere before reading this review or even . With that in mind, first, let me answer the three most frequently asked questions in this review. I assume these are what most readers are interested in anyway.\\n\\n1. Mostly no. But yes, there is one that I (personally speaking, you might not agree) consider a spoiler for . Ghostbloods is a major organization in . Knowing its existence from reading is not too much of a big deal. However, reading will give away the identity of the leader behind Ghostbloods. In , this was not revealed until the end of . Speaking of spoilers, if you're reading in an ebook format like I did, I think it would be wise to skip reading the table of content. It doesn't take a genius to predict a major event in from the table of content.\\n\\n2. This is a trickier question than it sounds. Cosmere is now interconnected so deeply, and sooner or later, you will miss plenty of connections or get spoiled if you decide to skip an installment or two. Some call this a chore; I call it a charm. But just in case, I will put a spoiler tag here on which books I think you should read to enhance your enjoyment of . It goes without saying that you should read every book in first, and this includes . These are a MUST before reading . But I think you should also read\\n. Once again, these are NOT mandatory. Reading every book in should suffice, but personally, I would have been lost or confused in plenty of sections in if I didn't read the books I mentioned before reading .\\n\\n3. Absolutely yes.\\n\\nSimilar to the publication time gap between and , the story in begins six years after the end of . The hunt for the shadowy organization, the Set, continues once more. And after Wax discovers and confirmed a new type of bomb that can unleash an unprecedented level of destruction is in the Set's possession, he realizes he must once more take on the role of Harmony’s Sword, together with Wayne, Marasi, and Steris. Especially after hearing Harmony's immortal agent inform that Harmony's power is somehow blocked in Bilming. As I mentioned earlier in this review, one of the conflicts of involves offworlders beyond Scadrial, both protagonists and antagonists. And as a and Cosmere fan, I will say this: I loved reading the non-stop race against time in . is filled with an engaging plot, empathizing characterizations, and ambitious world-building. The themes of politics, justice, responsibility, forgiveness, individualism, science, love, friendship and redemption were written and compounded magnificently. No page in felt redundant to me, especially if you are caught up with all the books in Cosmere, and everything eventually reached an incredibly satisfying conclusion.\\n\\nIt was a time of ashfalls and tyrants in . Drowned by the cloud of darkness, the power of an evil god, and surrounded by charred bodies, a new myth, legend, and group of heroes were forged. And the characters and story in the first trilogy became the foundational lore for the entire . Willingly or not, the events in will traject the main characters of the second era of toward a similar path. They're guaranteed to become legends in the third era of , which, if all goes according to plan, will have its first installment might begin in the year 2025 or 2026.\\n\\nI always appreciate when an author succeeds at making every book, including the final installment, in their series imbued with substantial character development. Sanderson's quality of writing has improved so much since , and I think this is reflected most in the character's development and world-building. Believe me, this is saying a LOT considering that I have always loved Sanderson's storytelling style. I just reread the entire up to , and it's easy to notice the steady increase in storytelling skills. I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise. aside, in the past six years, Sanderson also wrote , , , , , , three novellas, and four secret novels project. And I'm pretty sure there is more. If someone told me back then, after I finished the first , that I would love the main characters in as much as the main characters in the first , I would've immediately dismissed the notion. But certainly proved me wrong.\\n\\nWax, Wayne, Marasi, and Steris (starting from ) are the core characters of . But even then, it is easy to say that Wax has received the most spotlight and development throughout the series up to . Steris did not become one of my favorite heroines of all time until . There isn't much more room for Wax and Steris to develop as characters and a couple, but I'm gratified to read about their relationship development. The slow-burn romance building and realization of how much they grew to care about each other were well-written throughout the series. And I think it is safe to say I've come to love Wax and Steris as much as I love the relationship between Vin and Elend, even if it's for different reasons. Wax and Steris have the most mature relationship out of all of Sanderson's couples in the Cosmere. The way they complement and support each other while acknowledging each other's strengths and weaknesses were inspiring. And even if there weren't too many scenes in to showcase this, every interaction and fond thought they had effectively displayed it.\\n\\nBut of course, the series wouldn't be titled without the duo and bromance of... well, Wax and Wayne. Wax and Wayne have often been one of my favorite duos of all time in fantasy, and has highly cemented their position in my rank. The sense of trust and understanding Wax and Wayne have toward one another and how they constantly lift each other up when their partner is down were palpable, heartwarming, and entertaining in equal measure. I'm confident readers will be satisfied with the end of their journey, like I did. And speaking of Wayne... Wayne is one of the two characters that developed the most in . It was unbelievable. Look, I liked Wayne. As I said, I've continuously loved the Wax and Wayne duo. But Wayne has always been... Wayne. Yes, we saw him hide his pain and regret behind his jokes and happy-go-lucky attitude in the previous books. However, we finally really the maximum depth and complexity of his character and personality in . Now that we're at the end of the series, I have to say that if I have to choose, I will have to say I love Wayne more than Wax as an individual.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is one more main character that developed the most in other than Wayne: Marasi Colms. Marasi, to me, felt like an integral character overshadowed by the presence of the other characters in the previous books. Sure she has some moments in the spotlight, but relatively, they were repeatedly too short to remember. When I reread , I forgot most of her actions and roles in the series. Fortunately, this situation has been fixed thoroughly in . The new duo of Marasi and Wayne was so good, and I can't go into details on this. But Marasi, together with other characters from other worlds and series, played an irreplaceable role in the plot of . And I had a blast every moment of reading her POV chapters here. I have no doubt Cosmere fans will feel the same as I did.\\n\\nAlright, let's talk a bit about Worldhopper characters. If you're a Cosmere fan like me, it's hard to imagine the possibility of the Worldhopper characters and their magic's existence in this book not becoming one of the highlights for you. It unquestionably was for me. Again, no spoilers on their identity, but there were at least eight Worldhopper characters from other worlds (mostly Sel) and series in this book. Most of these appearances and scenes are texts you should RAFO for yourself. I will, however, mention I am in awe of every scene involving two dominant Worldhoppers in : Moonlight and TwinSoul. Moonlight (No, I will not tell you her identity) is one of my favorite characters in the entire Cosmere. Assuming that I'm not wrong, though. To see her appearing in , exhibiting her magic system and playing a role in the story, made my heart soar with glee and excitement. I did not expect it at all, and it was a truly welcome surprise. And then there is TwinSoul, who I believe to be a completely new character in the Cosmere. Sanderson mentioned in the author's note at the beginning of the book:\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this is where TwinSoul comes in. You heard that right. Indian lore and mythology now have a place in the Cosmere, and the results of this inclusion that I witnessed here were bloody outstanding and memorable. Seriously, Moonlight and TwinSoul, for lack of better words, were so damn cool and awesome. Simple as that.\\n\\nI don't think it is far-fetched to call the Cosmere volume equivalent of MCU . Remember, this is the final book in the second era . That fact, plus the high quantity of Cosmere crossovers and magic systems in , summoned one of the best Sanderlanche so far. From my perspective, almost the entirety of the second half of counts as the Sanderlanche portion. It was more or less 200 pages of action scenes with brief respites. Terrible forces are moving in the Cosmere, and the stakes of the imminent devastation the characters need to prevent were the most dangerous and epic in scope out of all the books in . It has been two years since I read , and I have missed my time of reading a new pulse-pounding Sanderlanche sequence full of carnage, peril, explosions, and emotions. As scenes dissolve into crystal-clear vivid imagery, I was once again reminded why I never fail to think of Sanderson as one of the best authors in crafting memorably superlative climax sequences in epic fantasy.\\n\\nMagic systems from other series and massive Cosmere implications aside, successfully made me more eager for the future of . Scadrial continues to be one of my favorite worlds in fantasy. I may not love it as much as Roshar, but it is still one of my cherished worlds in the genre, and it is undoubtedly one of the most special ones for me. With the arrival of new metals, the evolution and combination of allomancy, feruchemy, and hemalurgy ceaselessly keep the magic system, actions, and world-building in Scardrial mesmerizing. Also, one of my favorite factors of reading Sanderson's book is the function of advancing technologies and science in his world. But this was never done at the expense of forgetting the core history of each respective world in Cosmere. In , Sanderson constantly relates to the events of the first while at the same time showing how technologies and science believably transform the world of Scadrial. Based on what I've read here, it is more possible than not that the next era of will be more superb, intricate, and mind-blowing.\\n\\nLet's end this review, shall we? is a spectacular and explosive ending to series. It is a half half Cosmere crossovers novel. Though a finale is relatively rare in his career, with and , Sanderson proved how great he is at writing a concluding volume in the Cosmere. And this quantity won't stay this way for long. We will have the conclusion to series next year and then the conclusion to Part 1 the year after. I feel blessed to partake in this decades-long Cosmere adventure. And without a doubt, is my second favorite installment in the entire , up there with , just slightly below which I'm completely biased on. Thank you so much, Brandon Sanderson, for producing another exceptional novel and concluding book in and The Cosmere. I am equally rewarded and brimming with questions and theories. I am looking forward to reading the third era of the saga whenever it's ready. Until then, to all of you reading this review.

       " 'Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions upon finishing reading fantasy books.\\n\\nOh no Brandon...what are you doing?!?!\\n\\nThis is a very frustrating review to have to write. I\\'m a BIG Brandon Sanderson fan - with many of my all time favorite books being written by him, I consider him one of my top 5 favorite authors of all time. And while I haven\\'t been in love with the Mistborn: Era 2 books thus far, they have all been passable. This one however, for me, was absolutely atrocious from beginning to end.\\n\\nFirst, I absolutely loathe Wayne - who is a main character that is featured on a large number of pages here. His entire character is written to be funny, and with humor being as subjective as it is, for me personally his humor fails to hit the mark. The \"funny\" Sanderson characters tend to follow a similar arc where they are more silly than outright funny, but Wayne is almost like a caricature of that with how over the top he is. A younger me would have been a bigger fan of his, but the type of humor I enjoy has changed over time and sadly that no longer appeals to me.\\n\\nI\\'m frustrated with the overall structure of this book. Most Sanderson books follow a similar arc where they are decently written from a writing style perspective, but end up being absolutely wonderful due to the wonderful worldbuilding, magic systems, and most importantly - his expert usage of twists. There was no twist in this book, and the book massively suffered as a result.\\n\\nWhat we were left with was a rather mediocre thriller book, and if that is what I wanted to read I would just go pick up a Tom Clancy book and read something great. But Sanderson isn\\'t an amazing thriller writer, and it really showed here.\\n\\nThe main villain has inexplicably switched to a new person after 3 books to a brand new villain in the 4th book. It feels shoehorned in, and has a severe lack of character development and felt very rushed. That is never a good strategy to use as an author, and weakens the overall plot of the entire series by making it feel extremely disjointed.\\n\\nThe beginning of this book contained a huge number of info dumps, something that is not normally a Sanderson style, and ends up feeling very strange and out of place. I could understand it a bit more in the first book of a series, but we are in the 4th and final book and the time for that has come and gone a long time ago.\\n\\nMy main problem with this book however is the extreme usage of Cosmere references. And I am left feeling like the Cosmere as a whole is suffering as a result. Every other page feels \"cosmere\" this, and \"investiture\" that, and what went from a very mellow sprinkling in previous Cosmere books turned into the central feature of this book. I get why many people, if not most, will love this aspect of the book - but what made me love the Stormlight books was the subtle nature to the Cosmere references. It felt like a secret you were being let in on, and that most readers just didn\\'t catch onto - it has some mystery to it and left you wanting more. Now it\\'s over the top and feels like a very poor direction for the Cosmere books to go. I\\'m not even sure previous book said the word Cosmere more than once or twice, but it\\'s used many dozens of times and feels out of place.\\n\\nThere is a huge amount of deus ex amchina now implemented due to the extreme Cosmere tie ins, and it cheapens the thrill here when characters can come in and solve problems using powers that are only relevant in other books on other words. It ends up not really feeling like a mistborn book.\\n\\nIf you read \"Mistborn: Secret History\" you will know that a certain character is heavily featured here, and I absolutely hated that reveal. It cheapened the fate of this character and felt like it was being way too cute. That character now is featured, and I hate the direction that this took. Not only that, but the reveal of this character in Mistborn: Era 2 was a huge cliffhanger in the 3rd book, with so many questions left lingering that just simply do not get solved here.\\n\\nUltimately, with Mistborn Era 1 we had an absolutely amazing ending that tied up the series in a beautiful way - and with Era 2 it ended up feeling like it didn\\'t need to be written. This entire Era could have just been a wiki blurb, or at most a novella, and it would have served its purpose. The ending of Era 2 leaves with pretty much zero plot development and ends up just being a prelude for Era 3.\\n\\nIf you are one of the MANY people who absolutely loved this book, I\\'m jealous of you and am happy you found enjoyment. But for me personally, I\\'m left with huge doubts over the future of Mistborn, and major concerns of the future of all Cosmere books.',\n",

It would be a daunting task for every reader of The Lost Metal, especially if you’d fallen in love with these amazing characters…\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 5-star rating says a lot but it doesn’t say it all. For one thing, though I gave both five stars, The Lost Metal easily replaced The Bands of Mourning as the best entry of Era 2, and possibly the best of the entire Mistborn series. While Hero of the Ages had a more complex and thrilling plot, I had come to love the characters of the new era a lot more. They all shared a perfect combination of habitability, believability and complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust to make the review complete, I’ll repeat this line once more, but without much elaboration to keep the review concise: this is world building, character development, magical systems, mystery and adventure at their best, while also nicely complemented by humor and suspense.

As such, there's a lot I can't say due to spoilers - but this was a mostly satisfying conclusion to the Wax & Wayne era, with plenty of tidbits to get people excited for further Cosmere as well as specifically Mistborn Era 3.\\n\\nWhat I can say about TLM is that it's my favorite of the Era 2 books, and my third favorite overall after HoA and TFE. There are a lot of excellent scenes in this book, for all types of fans - Era 1 fans, Era 2 fans, Cosmere enthusiasts. Some of the character moments in this book are very touching or cool, although I felt like Sanderson tried too hard to make people speak their life lessons into dialogue a bit too blatantly.\\n\\nThe action was also really entertaining, and this is something that hasn't worked for me in Era 2 as well. The plot of this one is probably my second favorite after Shadows of Self, I was consistently engaged.\\n\\nRegarding Cosmere Easter eggs...there are loads! I don't think you *need* to have read anything other than Mistborn, but it's definitely the most Cosmere forward book so far. Some of the things in this book had me SO STOKED and I can't wait to talk about them.\\n\\n\\nWhere I think this book will really decide how it lands is on how you feel about Wayne. Wayne is a very conflicting character to me that I don't feel like Sando handles as well as he could balancing the humor and tragedy inherent in him. This is a very Wayne heavy book even from the beginning (Wayne childhood prologue) and some of the best moments are Wayne moments, and my least favorite, groan worthy parts are also Wayne moments. I think all of the main cast of this subseries get a satisfying arc, Wayne included, but the balance of juvenile humor was tilted a bit too far for me ultimately.\\n\\nEra 1 fans get some *amazing* scenes, though. If you love the original trilogy and have delayed/found Era 2 lacking, I really think you should try to get to this one and you'll be rewarded.\\n\\nThis will be really rewarding to reread, and I left TLM sad to see these characters go.\\n\\n9/10\",\n",

Actually, I really enjoyed this book, but oh boy, there is so much to say. This will be 100% percent spoiler free.\\n\\nI’ve had quite a rocky relationship with I read the first two books, and , earlier this year and didn’t particularly enjoy them that much. I didn’t think they were terrible, but I didn’t feel very invested, so I took a break from this series. Wait three months, and I am in the mood to give this Era 2 a fair second chance. I started from again, read that one, and then instantly picked up and and this time around, I actually really enjoyed it. My expectations were set appropriately when I picked up this series for the second time, and it was like a new reading experience. I started caring for the characters, the plot, the writing style and overall, it was a great reading experience. Not as good as Mistborn Era 1 or anything like that, but nonetheless, worth reading.\\n\\nSo, having gone on this back-and-forth journey with what did I think about This was a fascinating read because I am not caught up with all the books in the cosmere. I have read almost everything in the Cosmere except books 2 to 4 in the and\\n\\nLet’s answer the big question. Are we finally seeing Sanderson starting to pull stuff and worlds together? The answer to that is... I won’t go into specifics, but there are some pretty major cosmere tie-ins, especially in the latter half of this book. Other worlds are mentioned, and more stuff like that, so if you are a HUGE Cosmere fanatic, you will probably love this book. is an important book for the cosmere. No doubt about it.\\n\\nAnd that leads to the other question. The answer to that is.... While there are many cosmere references, they are not the most important thing about this book. Moreover, you are not supposed to understand all of these references. It is clear that Sanderson is setting up by hinting at different things\\n\\nBut let’s go a bit more into detail. Let’s talk about why I think this is an excellent book and why I don’t think this is Sanderson’s best work to date.\\n\\nFirstly, why is it good? Let’s start with the characters.\\n\\nSanderson delivers some incredibly satisfying conclusions to these characters’ arcs. This cast of characters you’ve followed on this big journey are coming to the end of this massive conflict, and I think that Sanderson delivers on giving readers a satisfying conclusion to their journey. The characters’ growth, arcs and conclusions are satisfying, which is excellent news.\\n\\nSecondly, the pacing is spot on. You constantly move between the different POVs, and the short chapters make this feel like a very quick read, But this is actually the longest Mistborn Era 2 book at 500 pages. The plot thickens and has many turns and twists, and the action is almost non-stop.\\n\\nThirdly, if you are a cosmere fanatic, you will appreciate this book because there are so many references and tie-ins happening in this book. Fans will make theories and try their best to guess what this book means for the cosmere world going forward, which is always fun.\\n\\nFourthly, a bit of different praise, but the epilogue of this book is amazing. Every chapter in this book is, on average, less than ten pages, but the epilogue is 35 pages and split into shorter chapters. After the main event in this book, we get to see the aftermath and how the events in this book have impacted various characters across a period of 2 years! Sanderson brilliantly wraps up some of these characters’ arcs and also sets up a lot of things for Mistborn Era 3 and potentially even Mistborn Era 4.\\n\\nFifthly, this book has a phenomenal Sanderson Avalanche or Sanderlanche, as some people call it. Everything comes together at the end, and the last act is filled with incredible character moments, twists and turns, and lots of action. I read the last 120 pages in one sitting because I couldn’t put it down because I needed to know what would happen.\\n\\nSixth and lastly, this book wraps up Era 2 really nicely. While reading this series, the first three books might feel a bit episodic. However, this book shows that all the books in this series are incredibly important. Things that happen in Alloy of Law are essential for how the events in unfold, and I appreciate that.\\n\\nHowever, this is not Sanderson’s best work-to-date, and I would even say that this is not even the best book to date, albeit it is good. So let’s talk about what held this book back from being a 5 out of 5 stars read for me.\\n\\nis an excellent book for fans of the cosmere and people that love Mistborn Era 2, but it is not perfect, and here is why. Almost all of Sanderson’s previous series have evident beginnings and ends, and it is usually a very self-contained story. In this one, you have a satisfying conclusion to the main characters’ arcs, but this last book does not feel like a proper, proper conclusion if that makes sense. Sanderson sets up some things that will be important for later series, and to be able to make that happen, Sanderson has to introduce a sub-plot that didn’t feel 100% as it belonged in this book. Some readers might not agree with this point here, but I didn’t feel like the plot was as tight as and\\n\\nIn conclusion, has lots of great character moments, excellent pacing and an overall satisfying conclusion. The plot just didn’t feel as tightknit as some of Sanderson’s other books, but overall, I had a wonderful time reading this book.\\n\\nThank you to Gollancz for a physical copy in exchange for an honest review!',\n",
       " \"“What’s harder, love?” she asked. “Doing what’s right or doing what’s wrong?”\\n“Doing what’s right.”\\n“So who gets stronger?” Ma asked. “The fellow what does the easy thing, or what does the hard thing?”\\n\\n\\n“The Lost Metal” is the fourth and final book in the Mistborn: Wax and Wayne series, best known as Era 2 of the This was a blockbuster. This book was a sanderlanche from beginning to end with surprises left and right and what an ending.\\n\\nSix years have passed since the events of “The Bands of Mourning” and Waxillium Ladrian has laid down his coat and gun to take up the pen. Now Senator, he spends most of his time fighting off laws that threaten war between Elendel and the Outer cities as well as trying to prevent another war between the Basin and the Malwish in the South. Steris, now Lady Ladrian, uses her expertise in organisation to manage the household and find evidence and clues to aid the prevention of war.\\n\\nMarasi and Wayne have been partners for the past six years. As Steris and Wax deal with the politics, the two of them have been hunting down any leads to the activities of the Set. The people kidnapped in the first book have never been found and now stockpiles of weapons have been found that threaten to add fire to the tensions between Elendel and the Outer cities.\\n\\nWhen Wax discovers a potential nuclear disaster in the making, he must once more take up the mantle of Harmony’s sword to fight the battles He can’t. Steris is left as the head of House Ladrian and must overcome her perceived ‘weaknesses’ and aid Elendel in its time of need. Marasi, who feels that she could be doing more, is recruited by a team of offworlders who know more but share less of what they understand of the god Trell, to aid in the protection of Scadrial. And while we’ve seen the characters develop: Wax and Marasi in the first three and Steris in the last book, this was the book dedicated to Wayne’s development.\\n\\n\\n\\nWayne is not having a good time. He really isn’t and it was hard to read. Wayne has always been the comic relief. The one to ease the tension with a crude joke or something outrageously ridiculous. The one to mask his pain with a laugh. So reading him being depressed and forced to feel the pain he’s hidden for so long, made me tear up. He’s been my favourite character from the series, him and Steris, and reading him in pain had me in pain. He has people who love him surrounding him but he’s so used to hiding it away, he never brings it up and with the possible end of his city, there’s too much going on. Luckily, he has his family by his side.\\n\\nThe relationships of this series are some of the best. A certain scene…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n...had me so happy. These people have grown together so much. Wax and Steris as a couple, Marasi and Steris as sisters, Marasi and Wayne as partners, Wax and Marasi as friends, Wax and Wayne as brotherly best friends and now even Steris and Wayne get along. It just makes me so emotional. I love them all so much and I was so sad to be done with their story when I closed the book.\\n\\nLike I said, this was a Sanderlanche from beginning to end. The events literally take place in a day and it was the most exhausting day they’ve ever had. Also, forget Bands of Mourning, this is the most Cosmere aware book. This was an epic crossover with characters we’ve met from other books and worlds hopping in to save the fate of the planet. The number of times I gasped in surprise when I realised which character was being introduced. Epic. Epic from beginning to end. And some characters, especially one I can't say because spoilers,, are sus as hell, not Harmony though. I am a Harmony apologist through and through and I stand by Him lying to a certain character. Also, if you've finished the book, do you ever think about ?\\n\\nThe Mistborn Saga is one of my favourite worlds and while I’m sad to be leaving another group behind, I’m excited to move to the next era. I’ve learned so much from this series. About love, about faith, about trust, about discovering one's self. I’m getting so emotional writing this but as Mama Wayne said:\",\n",
       " \"That was rusting incredible! It's been 14 years since Hero of Ages that Sanderson had given us a series conclusion and he has once again stuck the landing for another Mistborn conclusion. And I think he did even better this time.\\n\\nThe Lost Metal was pretty much the perfect finale. The last few books provided the much needed foundation of the worldbuilding especially around the progression of the magic system, and developing characters that we know and loved so much, and the basis of the overarching story for Mistborn Era 2. Armed with this strong foundation, this finale was a high-stakes, fast-paced story that pointed our main characters towards the primary threat almost right from the get-go. I was a bit surprised and delighted that we also got some answers pretty early in the book, and typical of Sanderson, continued to get more which were craftily scattered throughout the narrative keeping me absolutely riveted. However, despite the pace and the revelations, and the amount of incredible action scenes, we still got plenty of character moments which continue to develop our characters even more. The ending was a beautifully bittersweet one, and one which will keep me thinking about it for days and weeks to come.\\n\\nThen we have the Cosmere stuff. Holy moly, when Sanderson said this will be the most Cosmere-aware book to date, he wasn't kidding and I was loving it to bits. As he said in his release party, the gloves are finally off. There's no holding him back now and it's only going to get even more exciting and fun from now on. Can someone without knowledge of the Cosmere still enjoy this book? I believe so as the characters are amazing in their own right, and the action scenes are classic Sanderson - freaking cool and cinematic. But you'll miss out on the extra layer of excitement and the fun of discovery and connecting the bigger picture.\\n\\nis not a big book by Sanderson's standards. That he managed to pack so much in this and yet keep it so well-balanced clearly shows the vast improvement in his writing skills since the first Mistborn trilogy and . The best example of this I think was in the Prologue. A perfectly executed scene and PoV chapter that will hit you right in the gut with just one sentence right at the very end, it made me understand that one single character (okay, it's Wayne) even better without having to spend an inordinate amount of time in his head. It also magnifies the moments you spend in Wayne's head in his following PoV chapters throughout the book. As for the rest of the characters, rest assured that they were in no way sidelined and everyone was given their moment to shine and grow into their role in the overall story. The more I think about it, the more I think that this could be Sanderson's finest character work to date.\\n\\nI might rewrite this review as I'm just regurgitating my (spoiler-free) thoughts. But safe to say, there's a reason Sanderson is my favourite author of all-time, and he's staying at that top spot.\",\n",

It\\'s only the very beginning of the book, and we\\'re already greeted by our familiar heroes and their interactions, detective work, social investigation and pressures, and explosive action, just as I\\'ve come to expect and enjoy from Sanderson, especially in this series.\\n\\nA couple specific developments in the last book are looking to develop greatly in this one, and I\\'m chomping at the bit to see how Wax and the gang resolve their searches and goals, while also being excited to see how Sanderson incorporates discoveries in this entry into both the world of Scadriel and into the Cosmere at large. I will defintely be looking to buy \"The Lost Metal\" on release without a moment\\'s hesitation thanks to my trust in Sanderson as an author and thanks to how things are looking to set up and play out in a way that I\\'m sure will throw me for a loop.',\n",

       " '3.75\\n\\nMy most anticipated read of the year was on its way to becoming my most disappointing.\\n\\nThe Mistborn series is one of my favourites. The Final Empire is still one of the best Fantasy books I\\'ve read to date. After being blown away by the original trilogy, I was super excited to get to 2nd Era.\\nAre they as good as 1st Era? In my opinion, no. Not that they aren\\'t great, but I very much like philosophical themes in books I read, and, even though 2nd Era has its moments, it is not as heavy or thought provoking. Which is fine, because I don\\'t think it was trying to be that. They are light and fun books with great character interactions. Never really hitting that five star mark for me, but they have consistently been enjoyable reads.\\nThen the epilogue in Bands of Mourning happened.\\nSo, naturally, I was unbelievably excited for TLM. It seemed to be a big book in the Cosmere.\\n\\nSo why was it almost disappointing? A couple reasons.\\n\\nFor starters, it was slow. I don\\'t mean The Godfather slow, I mean it felt like nothing happened for the first 150 pages. Like, they established what was happening, then there was just a bunch of info-dumps and meaningless character interactions. A lot of things that were explained, that I already knew, and we went over them multiple times. Not something I have ever noticed in a Brandon Sanderson book.\\nAfter that, it picked up a little. But at the same time, I found Marasi\\'s POV to bore me. I actually don\\'t like her as a character. In my opinion she is one of, if not, Brandons worst MC. For some reason, she irritates me at times, and is pretty bland. So anytime she was in the story, I always felt like I\\'d rather be reading about Wax, Wayne or Steris. That might be a me problem honestly, but she was featured a lot in this book.\\n\\nUsually, Wayne is amazing. He is super funny, but in this book, a lot of his humour was very juvenile and childish, even for him. They sounded like something my little cousin would say, and that made it cringe-y sometimes. Still was funny, but not as much as in previous books.\\nSteris is awesome, she is probably my favourite female Sanderson character. She\\'s so unique and unlike anything character I\\'ve read before.\\nWax is cool, if a bit boring. I don\\'t not like him but he certainly isn\\'t a favourite.\\n\\nSo I\\'m halfway through the book, thinking \"Oh man, this so disappointing.\"\\n\\nUntil the last 150 pages, which is arguably one of the greatest Sanderlanches I\\'ve ever read.\\n\\nI read almost all of it in one siting, I couldn\\'t rip the book away, and every time I did, I just wanted to go right back. The stakes were so high, some of the highest they have ever been in the Mistborn series, and I didn\\'t notice the gravity of the situation until that last 20%. The way Brandon wrote it was incredible, absolutely amazing. Seriously. I\\'m tempted to just read it again, even though he did something (if you know, you know) that I\\'m still salty about, but he handled it superbly, to the point where I was kind of happy.\\n\\nBut another disappointment I had was the Cosmere references. I thought they\\'d be better, honestly. Besides that certain group of people, the others felt pretty pedestrian. I guess that might be what Brandon wanted to do, but I don\\'t know.\\nAnd that thing about Secret History didn\\'t really make much a of a big difference in this book. It was a bit of a let down, honestly, how little we saw of that character. I though he would be a bigger plot line.\\n\\nSo now, I can\\'t say I\\'m too disappointed. There were some things that I didn\\'t love, but do think this is a worthy addition to both Mistborn and the Cosmere. Definitely a must-read for any Cosmere fans, because big things happen in the Epilogue (or, rather, are going to lead to big things).\\n\\n*STOP HERE UNLESS YOU\\'VE READ THE LOST METAL*\\n\\nOkay, I wanna hear everyones opinion; who is Moonlight?',\n",
       " '\"No puedes seguir desenterrando el cadáver de quien eras antes. No puedes seguir cargando con él de un lado a otro. Déjalo enterrado. Plantéate quién eres, no a quién dejaste atrás\"\\n\\nMás de 10 años después de la publicación de \"Aleación de ley\" nos llega el esperado cierre de la Segunda Era de Mistborn, ese que pone punto y final a las aventuras de Wax, Wayne y Marasi. Manteniendo el tan característico tono humorístico de la saga y la extraordinaria química entre sus personajes, Sanderson pone fin a una trama a la vez que nos deja entrever el comienzo de algo muchísimo mayor.\\nUna declaración de intenciones de lo que Sanderson planea hacer con el Cosmere, de cómo todas las tramas individuales de las distintas sagas terminarán desembocando en algo mucho más enorme y ambicioso. Y vaya si lo hace bien.\\n\\n\"El metal perdido\" tiene el mismo ritmo frenético que sus predecesores, con momentos cargados de acción y tensión, equilibrados con otros tiernos y entrañables entre sus personajes, aderezado todo ello con una cantidad ingente de referencias a otros libros pertenecientes al Cosmere. El desarrollo de los personajes sigue siendo tan magistral como lo fue hasta el momento, con arcos que te dejan el corazón en un puño, otros que te dan descanso y alivio y otros que te hacen soltar alguna lagrimilla traicionera. Porque sí, el humor sigue estando muy presente, pero eso no quiere decir que no lo vayáis a pasar mal, os lo aseguro.\\n\\nEn cuanto a la pregunta del millón... Todo esto por supuesto es mi opinión en base a mi experiencia, pero creo que se trata de una novela que se disfruta muchísimo más si ya estás bastante versado en el Cosmere. Directamente dejaría esta novela para el final, después de leer todo lo demás. Ya no solo por las numerosas referencias, sino que directamente creo que roza el spoiler con alguna de las demás historias. Se nombran también ciertos temas que ya se han explicado y desarrollado en otras novelas, lo que puede dejar un poco confuso y desubicado al lector si no ha escuchado antes hablar de ellos. Y no solo eso, sino que además la propia trama principal es bastante crossover y no se limita solo a Scadrial.\\nMi recomendación sin duda es dejar si no toda la segunda era, al menos este último libro para el final. Ahora bien... Si solo queréis leer Mistborn... ¿Se puede entender \"El metal perdido\" sin haber leído lo demás? En términos generales, sí. La historia de estos personajes queda MUY bien cerrada y creo que puede ser un final muy satisfactorio a pesar de tener esos momentos de confusión y esa sensación de \"me está faltando información aquí\". Es más, si algo tengo que destacar, porque me ha gustado mucho, es que me parece que sitúa muy bien a todos los personajes al final de la historia con varios epílogos, para que no te quede ninguna duda ni ningún frente abierto.\\nAún así, si tenéis pensado leeros todo el Cosmere... Mi consejo es que no tengáis prisa y disfrutéis de las cosas en orden para sacarle el máximo provecho.\\n\\nHa sido una lectura intensa, llena de emociones y momentos que me han hecho saltar de la silla. He reído, llorado y disfrutado enormemente de esta historia, y guardaré a sus personajes siempre en mi corazón. Nos despedimos de esta Era, pero sabiendo que algo incluso más potente está por llegar.',\n",
       " 'Downgraded to a 3 after reflecting on it.\\n\\n———\\n\\nI really liked the start, but my gosh does this book drag in places. Felt like it needed about 100-150 pages shaving off. The humour didn’t work for me at all. It’s quite childish humour, and given that that’s not the target market, thought it was a bit bizarre. There’s quite a lot of exposition in this book too. This took me out of the story multiple times and made the reading experience tiring.\\n\\nThe things that saved it for me were the start and how quickly the world felt familiar. I also really enjoyed the two main female characters.\\n\\nA mixed bag but I’m glad I read it. I’m also happy that it’s over.\\n\\nFull review to come on my channel.',\n",
       " 'I’d give it a million stars if I could! An INCREDIBLE conclusion!\\n\\n“Tonight Waxillium embraced that duty. He became destruction incarnate. For to worship Harmony was not only to worship Preservation—it was also to worship Ruin, with all that implied.”\\n\\nHere we are folks, my journey through the Cosmere has finally led me to the epic conclusion of Mistborn era two and my gosh does this book end with a Cosmere rippling bang. The Lost Metal is beyond an incredible journey that will lead you through mind-blowing discoveries, thrilling action scenes, humour and heartbreaking heartache.\\n\\nIt goes without saying but it bears repeating, you need to have read Mistborn era one to fully appreciate era two, but now I also need to urge you all to read Mistborn: Secret History because certain parts of The Lost Metal will not make sense unless you have. There are many other connections to Cosmere books too, and whilst it is helpful to have read Stormlight Archives, Elantris and other novellas found within Arcanum Unbounded, it is not vital. Please note this review may contain spoilers for Mistborn era one, the first three books of era two, it will contain spoilers for Mistborn: Secret History and mild spoilers for the other Cosmere books. It is too hard to write this review without mentioning characters or magic systems from other worlds.\\n\\nThe Lost Metal is the book where we finally get some answers. From the kidnappings of Allomancers in The Alloy of Law, the secrets of the Set and their true intentions, Harmony’s indecisiveness, Telsin’s treachery and the wider threat to Scadriel from unknown forces, all is skilfully brought together and revealed. Though as Sanderson repeatedly states, “there’s always another secret.”\\n\\nSince The Alloy of Law, the city of Elendel has been plagued by the criminal organisation known as, the Set. With the major leaders of this organisation being Wax’s uncle Edwarn and his sister Telsin, Waxillium has spent years trying to bring them down. Yet in the aftermath of finding the Bands of Mourning, Wax has now retired from being a notorious lawman and becomes a senate, swapping reining in criminals to reining in politicians instead, perhaps a job no easier and just as deadly. The Set will not go unchecked though as when Detective Marasi and her partner Wayne uncover suspicious weapons in the City of Bilming, they are once more hot on the tracks of the Set’s whereabouts. However, events escalate when Wax accidentally discovers a new type of bomb, one that could cause an immense amount of death and he fears the Set may already be planning to use it. To make matters even more dire, the God Trell is preparing for an invasion, his strings are pulled by a higher force within the Cosmere and Harmony, the God of Scadriel, is blinded to the events unfolding. He once again calls upon Wax to be his Sword, and our Dawnshot knows he is the last hope left, for if he fails the world will fall to ruin.\\n\\n“In the Roughs you depended on your gun, your instincts, and your ability to ask the right questions. Here he had to depend on others to do the right thing. And so far there had been no greater test of his faith in humanity-serial killers included--than working with politicians.”\\n\\nOur narrative picks up six years afterThe Bands of Mourning, and that passage of time is immediately felt. The lives of our characters have greatly progressed both in a professional and personal manner. Marasi is a well respected detective, no longer sidelined or mocked, Steris’ preparation and planning becomes ever more vital especially when dealing with politicians, she finally begins to see her worth, Wax buries the demons from his past and feels contentment in his life, and Wayne… Well Wayne remains himself but with an added layer of depth. Each character now has more responsibility and people they care for, making the stakes of their mission to stop the Set and the invasion ever more higher. It is clear the time for insecurities and second guessing has passed, these characters must now become the heroes Scadriel needs and put their skills into action one last time.\\n\\nSpeaking of action, this is perhaps the most action packed instalment in the Mistborn saga. I found Sanderson did a superb job of exploring the Metallic Arts even further and showing how the advancement of the magic system, particularly in the use of Hemalurgy, was both fascinating and frightful. In fact I loved how balanced this novel was, from characters facing the perils before them head on, to the politics, to laugh-out-loud humour, and to the breathtaking action sequences, this is a novel which never has a dull moment. Sanderson is a master of building powerfully charged characters, ones which fully embrace his intricate magic systems, yet they are never so powerful that they cannot be challenged, or even killed, and this time around Wax and Wayne meet their match in combat, quite literally. This created many exciting and quite amusing scenes throughout which of course I revelled in. We also see returning characters from Mistborn era one, which added an extra slice of delight. However, what this novel really excels at are the connections made throughout the Cosmere.\\n\\nHere is where my review becomes Cosmere spoilery so be warned.\\n\\nIf you have read Mistborn Secret History then you will know that Kelsier is not quite dead, and if you have read Oathbringer you will know of the organisation called the Ghostbloods, and if you have read Rhythm of War then you will know the leader of the Ghostbloods is revealed as Kelsier himself! With this in mind, Sanderson’s introduction of two key characters, Moonlight and TwinSoul, we finally see agents of the Ghostbloods come into play. Honestly, their introduction was epic, previously we had only seen the Ghostbloods in short glimpses here and there but in this novel they play a significant role. Seeing Moonlight and TwinSoul reveal their powers and knowing they came from other worlds, ones we have seen before and one new, elevated the narrative tenfold, and I feel most readers will agree. The absolute astonishing beauty of The Lost Metal is that Sanderson merges together different magic systems, not just that of Allomancy and Feruchemy. Different powers are used for different tasks in truly inventive and surprising ways, it is simply jaw-dropping. I feel going further Worldhoppers such as the Ghostbloods will no longer be lurking in the background, they are going to be central to events throughout the Cosmere, not just on Scadriel, the planet they are sworn to protect. Though whether they are a force for good remains to be seen, together they hold a vast array of powers and are certainly not to be underestimated.\\n\\n\"You ever feel,\" Wayne said, \"like you wish life was like the stories?\"\\n\"What do you mean?\" Hoid asked.\\n“There\\'s always a good ending in those stories. The ones my ma used to tell ... they meant something. People, they were worth something.\"\\n\"I think we live stories every day,\" Hoid replied. \"Ones that we will remember, and tell, and shape like clay to be what we need them to be.\"\\n\\nThe Cosmere is truly a genius concept, it is a labyrinth which I love cruising through and I find so much joy in seeing how the world\\'s interconnect in a multitude of ways. There is no doubt Sanderson is a master storyteller, his vision reaches far and beyond and each time he leaves his readers mind-blown.\\n\\nWhen I finished The Lost Metal a friend asked if I felt it was a satisfying conclusion, and I had to think. I was left with a few questions, more secrets I wanted revealing, but then that’s with all of Sanderson’s novels, I am always left wanting more which is no bad thing. Yet my answer would be, yes, overall this is a satisfying conclusion to Mistborn era two, one that is worthy of the highest of praise. I particularly loved the multiple epilogues, they gave us a glimpse into how the lives of each character fared and brought a sense of closure. This is a conclusion of epic proportions, a worthy farewell to these characters who have meant so much to us all, but we are also left with a slim hope that we will see them again, perhaps somewhere within the Cosmere.\\n\\nARC Provided by Jenna at Gollancz in exchange for an honest review.

Llevo diciendo últimamente que Sanderson se ha empezado a volcar en las conexiones del Cosmere y está dejando de lado la propia trama de los libros. Esta última entrega se podría resumir como: los malos quieren explotar una bomba y los buenos lo intentan detener. Ya está, no hay nada más a parte de la propia investigación en sí y durante varios tramos me ha costado continuar.\\nTampoco los protagonistas de esta Segunda Era son tan atractivos como los de la Primera. Para mí, Vin, Sazed y Kelsier estarán siempre por encima de todos.

Creo que hasta ahora es donde más información tenemos sobre lo que está ocurriendo en el Cosmere. Ya se habla abiertamente de planetas, dioses y los personajes que vemos solo fugazmente en otros libros ya empiezan a tener protagonismo. Es una muestra de lo potente que puede llegar a ser este universo compartido cuando explote todos sus recursos. Ya vemos distintos sistemas de magia interactuar entre ellos, distintos personajes provenientes de otras culturas y planetas e incluso personajes que pensábamos que no iban a volver tienen un hueco aquí.\\n\\nComo conclusión, cuatro estrellas que si eres fan de Cosmere vas a disfrutar como nunca pero que si buscas las mismas sensaciones que tuviste al leer El Imperio Final te vas a decepcionar bastante.',\n",

Yet she watches as her father unceremoniously banishes her mother, listens as her own worth is reduced to the marriage alliance she can secure. And when she calls upon the gods for help, they never seem to hear.\\n\\nDesperate for independence, she turns to the texts she once read with her mother and discovers a magic that is hers alone. With it, Kaikeyi transforms herself from an overlooked princess into a warrior, diplomat, and most favored queen.\\n\\nBut as the evil from her childhood stories threatens the cosmic order, the path she has forged clashes with the destiny the gods have chosen for her family. And Kaikeyi must decide if resistance is worth the destruction it will wreak—and what legacy she intends to leave behind.',\n",
       " 'I was encouraged by some readers to share a bit of information about Kaikeyi here that readers may be curious about. I believe Goodreads should stay a platform for readers, so I\\'ll be continuing my policy of avoiding this page after posting this.\\n\\nKaikeyi began many years ago, as I listened to my Aai and Ajji disagree about the character of Kaikeyi in the Ramayana. I’m so grateful I can share this brave, determined, and ultimately flawed character with you. I know that some people will read this book and be curious about my relationship to Hinduism or yes, even be angry about my portrayal of Hindu figures. I am a Hindu. It’s the religion that I love. I do not believe it to be above criticism, and I’ve written more about that if you\\'re interested. My Hinduism is one that can be critiqued, put through the wringer and come out stronger for it. I wrote this book for the Hindus who question their place in this religion because of patriarchy or fundamentalism, and for myself, because I love my religion and want to see it become better.\\n\\nIf you’re curious about my research, I have written more about some of my foundational sources in \\'s Author’s Note, as well as a bit about some of the changes I made from the plot of the original . There are truly too many changes to name, as this is not the you might have read or heard growing up. These changes are often, but not always, in service of the plot--it was important to me to establish that is a \"what-if\" style alternative rather than a faithful retelling of Valmiki\\'s from someone else\\'s perspective. If you want to have a conversation about I am more accessible on than here.\\n\\nWhat I love most about Hinduism is its ability to contain multitudes of stories, opinions, and contradictions. I love and its world. But I also love the and its original heroes. Part of me will always be the kid who loved the Diwali story of Rama’s homecoming (who am I kidding, it still brings me to tears!). It’s an absolute honor to add my voice to the long list of the ’s many reimaginings. Thank you for reading.',\n",

       " \"This was one of the books that I was most excited to read this year. I am a person who loves to read and reread epics like Mahabharata, Ramayana, and also books like Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita. I am also very fond of reading epic retellings. രണ്ടാമൂഴം Randamoozham by M.T. Vasudevan Nair and The Palace of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni are a few among my favorites. Some of my favorite authors loved this book and congratulated the author for the progressive way she wrote it. The hype and publicity given for this book were also very high. When I came to know that a young law student from the Midwest is the person behind this retelling, I became more curious to read it.\\n\\nI picked up the book to read as soon as I purchased it. All excitement was gone as I read about 200 pages of this book. This might be an epic retelling, and I appreciate the author's right to add additional subplots and alter the storyline of the actual book. But this one totally went wrong, and some mistakes in the story make this book lackluster.\\n\\nWhen you are writing a book from the perspective of a negative character from an epic, you should be very careful to handle the character in a mature way. One small mistake can destroy the whole book sometimes. I can say that the author didn't show this maturity in many parts of this book. How the author portrayed Rama's character will make many readers angry. This will hurt the religious sentiments of many people and has the propensity to cause a lot of controversies. The author might have known about the repercussions of this characterization as she hails from the Indian diaspora. In my opinion, she bravely took a risk that sadly backfired.\\n\\nI decided to DNF this book after reading 200 pages due to the inconsistencies in writing (it is brilliant in some areas and terrible in some other areas). Still, I completely read all the 496 pages as I badly wanted this book to succeed as I can clearly see the hard work and the research the author did for this book.\\n\\nThe biggest problem in this book is that the author uses the negative character in an epic to criticize the central characters by blaming them for patriarchy and grandiosity without considering the time period in which it was written and the societal standards people followed at that time. She uses the current political correctness to criticize an epic created thousands of years ago. I think that is the biggest disgrace you can do to a book, especially an epic.\\n\\nIn order to create sympathy towards some negative characters like Ravana and many others, she focuses on the small positives in them by totally discarding their more extensive negative qualities. Ravana was a rapist who raped Rambha, the queen of apsaras. I know about the author's liberty to do whatever they like to do in their creation (even if it is a retelling of an epic). But talking about political correctness on one side and doing this on the other was a little difficult for me to digest.\\n\\nI went back and rechecked the reviews of various authors who recommended this book. There was a similarity among all of them. They were all unfamiliar with Indian tradition and Ramayana. If they knew more about Ramayana (the original book on which this book is based), I doubt whether they would have given a high rating for this book and recommended it.\\n\\nBy general standards, books like these shouldn't affect religion or their followers as it is an author's personal literary creation, and people have common sense and are progressive enough to understand it. But after watching the severe Islamophobia that developed worldwide in the early part of the 21st century, we have to say that most people haven't progressed the way we expected them to. Social media, according to us, should make people closer. But it sadly acted as a catalyst to increase these phobias. So the authors should be cautious when writing novels like these as it has the propensity to act as a catalyst to create a global Hinduphobia among a few people that can cause devastating consequences.\\n\\nIf you are a religious Hindu without a progressive mindset, I suggest you to avoid this book as it might severely hurt your feelings. If you are a person who just wants some entertainment, you can try this book, keeping in the back of your mind that the author has taken her liberty to alter this retelling in her own way, and real Ramayana is different in many ways compared to this one.\\n\\nI loved the author's courage at a young age to retell Kaikeyi’s story in one of the most challenging ways possible, which even many established authors won't dare to do. But sadly, things didn't work the way she wanted to. So I can't give more than two stars to this book. Even though I wouldn't say I liked this book, I liked the author's writing style in a few parts of it, and I am looking forward to reading her next books as I think she has the potential and courage to write great books in the future.\",\n",
